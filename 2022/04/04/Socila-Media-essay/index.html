<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>As the technology develops, social media is becoming more and more popular among young people. Social media is often indicated as a virtual platform for creation or sharing resources. As a result, people can benefit from using social media because it is easier for them to access the resources from others to activate their own creations. In addition, because teenagers can share information on social media, it is also a proper platform for teenagers to maintain or expend their relationships with others. However, many problems are also caused by social media as the result of its virtuality which means there may be much fake or wrong information. For example, social media might cause addiction and teenagers might accept misleading information on social media.</p>
<h1 id="Thesis-statement"><a href="#Thesis-statement" class="headerlink" title="Thesis statement"></a>Thesis statement</h1><p>This article aims to analyze the effect of social media to teenagers in both positive and negative sides and discuss whether teenagers should use social media. Regarding my research, the benefits brought by social media to teenagers has exceeded the damage that it can cause.</p>
<h1 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h1><h2 id="Boosting-productivity-and-creativity"><a href="#Boosting-productivity-and-creativity" class="headerlink" title="Boosting productivity and creativity"></a>Boosting productivity and creativity</h2><p>Social media can boost the productivity and creativity of teenagers by using social media because social media is a platform for sharing resources. For example, teenagers can send messages to their friends, and they can see what the recent situations of their friends if they post it. According to the article (IOM, 2021), it is indicated that students may have a greater academic success with the help of social media. Teenagers can search information about their concerns or questions. By analyzing the information, their concerns may be solved, and they may have new ideas by combining the ideas of different resources. In addition, teenagers can discuss with other people by using social media. From the discussion, they can complete their own ideas and they may have the chance to access the thoughts of others which they do not think about before to improve their creativity. Additionally, if teenagers can compare their opinions with those from others, they can build a sense of critical thinking as communicating with others can help them think from different perspectives. In terms of evidence, this paragraph introduces a paper from an expert in this area and the evidence strongly proves the argument. With regard to its neutrality, the explanation is very objective. It does not show vested interest. However, this paragraph still needs some other kinds of evidence, such as data evidence. This paragraph is objective, and the evidence of this paragraph is strong. This paragraph could have been better if more various evidence can be used. </p>
<h2 id="Expanding-relationship"><a href="#Expanding-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Expanding relationship"></a>Expanding relationship</h2><p>Social media is beneficial for teenagers to expand their relationship with others. From a website (Dimock, 2021), it is indicated that over 94% of teenagers spend time chatting with their friends on social media. Teenagers can communicate with others on social media and make friends with them. For example, they may meet people who share the same interest. By chatting with them, people may become more familiar with each other. As a result, friendship is built between teenagers. Compared with previous generation, if previous people wanted to keep in touch with others, they had to write letters, which was very slow and inconvenient. With the help of social media, geographical limit can be broken, nearly all messages can be sent to its destinate on time quickly. Furthermore, the people that teenagers meet may come from all over the world which means teenagers can make friends without the limitation of geographic position and teenagers can learn foreign cultures and foreign knowledge from their foreign people. Also, by chatting with friends, teenagers will not feel lonely on social media because, as soon as they feel bored or lonely, they can find someone to talk on social media. In terms of structure, this paragraph does not contain counter argument, but this article mentions some negative opinions in other paragraphs. The evidence of this paragraph is strong because it is a fact in the form of data. This paragraph is strong because of its reasonable evidence and objective explanation.</p>
<h2 id="Expanding-horizons"><a href="#Expanding-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expanding horizons"></a>Expanding horizons</h2><p>Social media contributes to expand the horizons of teenagers. A website (Steyer, 2020) indicates that 54% of teenagers get news from social media. On social media, there is a large amount of news and daily reports. By reading them, teenagers can access to know what is happening that day. Also, there is no geographical limitation on social media, which means teenagers can access foreign information. By accessing the information from all over the world, their perspectives will not be limited in their living environment instead they can build an international version learning and understanding foreign cultures and learn things that they never see before. In addition, normally, on social media, different people have different opinions on the same event. By comparing the ideas of different people, it is helpful for teenagers to develop critical thinking. The evidence of this paragraph is strong as it uses data as a fact to prove its argument. However, this article concentrates too much on data evidence. It should also pay attention to the words of experts in this area. Though this paragraph is positive to social media, it still explains the argument objectively. This paragraph shows no vested interest and the evidence to this paragraph is closely related to the topic.</p>
<h1 id="Drawbacks"><a href="#Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h1><h2 id="Causing-mental-problems"><a href="#Causing-mental-problems" class="headerlink" title="Causing mental problems"></a>Causing mental problems</h2><p>Social media may cause mental problems among teenagers. From (Pack, 2021), it is indicated that over half of teenagers have been bullied online. Peerayuth (Peerayuth, 2018) indicates that social media may cause psychological problems, such as envy, in teenagers. Social media is a virtual platform so there is a large amount of fake information. Some people may post fake information about their life on the internet to show how well they are living. However, other people may not know the reality of information. As a result, they may think that they have fallen behind others which could cause depression, anxiety and envy. In addition, because of the virtuality of social media, it may lack of regulation so teenagers may suffer from cyber bullying and cyber fraud, which are also harmful for the development of psychology of teenagers. Additionally, on social media, there is nearly no regulation for teenagers so that they can do whatever they want on social media which might build harmful habits. For example, because teenagers are not regulated on social media, they might be self-willed in real life. Also, on social media, there might be something that attracts tanagers so much which cannot be got in real life. As a result, teenagers might escape themselves from real life and lose themselves on the virtual world built by social media. In terms of credibility, this author shows no vested interest, so it is believable. Also, there are both data evidence and essay evidence for this argument, so evidence are strong, such as 50% of teenagers are bullied and Peerayuth (2018). Furthermore, about structure, there is no inferential gap, and this article is objective and balanced. This paragraph is believable because of its neutrality, credibility and balanced structure</p>
<h2 id="Spreading-of-misleading-information"><a href="#Spreading-of-misleading-information" class="headerlink" title="Spreading of misleading information"></a>Spreading of misleading information</h2><p>There is misleading information in social media. Social media is a virtual platform so teenagers can access any information on the Internet, which means both helpful and misleading information may be spread. Normally, teenagers lack the ability to identify the property of information as they are not as mature as adults. Grant (Gross, 2018) has indicated that, in social media, fake news spread much faster than that you can imagine. As a result, if teenagers meet some harmful information, they may be misled. For example, there are many websites about sex and gambling on social media. If teenagers visit these websites and believe them, teenagers may be led to a wrong direction. It may cause both health and mental problems, even crime might be caused. Also, the spread of this kind of information is hard to regulate which means there is nearly no solution to prevent it from happening so the best solution is teaching teenagers identifying right and wrong as early as possible. This argument is very weak. First of all, there is only one evidence to support this argument. As a result, the credibility of the argument is low. Also, this argument is not balanced, it only focuses on the negative information of social media. However, the explanation of this argument is objective. This argument could be better. It can improve its evidence and it can add a counter argument for this argument.</p>
<h2 id="Causing-addiction"><a href="#Causing-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Causing addiction"></a>Causing addiction</h2><p>Social media may cause addiction among teenagers, which means teenagers may concentrate less on their studies. From Steyer (Steyer, 2020), it is indicated that 92% of teenagers go online every day and 24% say that they go online constantly. Also, 59% of parents say that they feel their kids are addicted to social media. Hou (Yubo, 2019) indicates that social media addiction may negatively affect the mental health and academic performance of teenagers. There are various functions on social media, such as watching videos and playing games. These kinds of functions may cause strong satisfaction among teenagers because teenagers can get what they cannot access on these functions. As a result, addiction may be caused because teenagers may feel more comfortable to using social media rather than doing their works. This may waste the time of teenagers on social media and cause teenagers to fall their works or studies behind. Also, spending too much time on social media may harm the health of teenagers, such as their eyes. Furthermore, if teenagers are addicted to social media, when they do their own works, they may concern their social media from time to time, which may reduce their concentration. In terms of evidence, this paragraph is strong as there are both data evidence and essay evidence from experts in this area and the evidence are closely related to the topic, which means there is no inferential gap. In terms of credibility, the author shows no vested interest. However, it does not mention counter argument in this paragraph so it could be more balanced. Regarding credibility, evidence and structure, this argument is strong and believable. However, it could have been better if counter argument is mentioned.</p>
<h1 id="The-comparison-of-both-perspectives"><a href="#The-comparison-of-both-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="The comparison of both perspectives"></a>The comparison of both perspectives</h1><h2 id="Perspective-one"><a href="#Perspective-one" class="headerlink" title="Perspective one"></a>Perspective one</h2><p>Three benefits are mentioned in perspective1 - boosting productivity, expanding relationship and widening horizons. For the first argument about productivity, there is no inferential gap, the evidence which is an article indicating students may have greater academic success with the help of social media is related to the topic. However, the credibility of the evidence is weak because it did not mention the author of the argument and the evidence did not demonstrate the exact quantitative evidence. Also, this evidence did not list reasons. The evidence of the second argument about expanding relationship is much stronger than the first one, which is a website demonstrating 94% of teenagers spend time chatting on social media. The source website is indicated, and it shows quantitative data. Also, the website is an authorized one. However, there is a slight inference gap of it because chatting on social media does not mean expansion of relationship directly. Teenagers chatting on social media may just communicate with their familiar friends instead of making friends with others so the topic of the second argument can be changed to expansion and maintenance of the relationship. The evidence of the third argument which indicates 54% of teenagers get news from social media is quite similar with that of the second one. There is a problem related to these two arguments, namely they lack the statement of experts in this area to support them. In short, almost all evidence in perspective one is related to their topics, but the common problems they face are the variety of evidence and credibility.</p>
<h2 id="Perspective-two"><a href="#Perspective-two" class="headerlink" title="Perspective two"></a>Perspective two</h2><p>Three opinions are mentioned in the second perspective, they are causing mental problems, spreading misleading information and addiction among teenagers. The first argument is credible as it both demonstrates statistical data and words from experts in its evidence and its evidence are quite strong and have a clear source. In addition, there is no inferential gap in the first opinion and the author explains clearly with accurate logic. However, the second opinion is not as credible as the first one. It only has one evidence to support its words, which leads to weakness. But the explanation is quite convincing because it gives example to support its content. The opinion could have been better if more convincing evidence are given. The third opinion with regard to addiction is quite strong. It gives credible evidence as the evidence contain both statistical data and words from authorized people in this area and all evidence give clear sources. In its explanation, it gives exact objects that can cause addiction and it analyses the reasons of addiction, which is convincing.</p>
<h2 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h2><p>Both perspective one and perspective two have advantages and disadvantages. However, generally, perspective two shows greater credibility as its evidence are more various and more convincing, and it both gives statistical data and words from experts. Also, its explanation is more objective. The only problem is that one of its opinions lack enough evidences.</p>
<h1 id="The-conclusion"><a href="#The-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The conclusion"></a>The conclusion</h1><p>From my perspectives, though social media has its drawbacks, the general influence of social media to teenagers is beneficial. For those drawbacks, they can be reduced or solved by technology methods. For example, if teenagers are addicted to games or any other entertainment software, their parents can set the time limit for their children, or the government can develop policies to limit assess time of specific software such as games to teenagers. Similar policies have been set in China and it has worked successfully. In addition, under the influence of COVID-19, it is hard for teenagers to go outside freely as before and many of them are even forced to have online lessons. As a result, social media plays a more and more important role in teenagers’ life, only as a study tool but also as a platform to communicate with others so I reckon that the advantages of social media exceed its disadvantages and teenagers should take the advantage of social media to improve them and fulfill their social life in such as special period.</p>
<h1 id="Reflection-and-evaluation"><a href="#Reflection-and-evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Reflection and evaluation"></a>Reflection and evaluation</h1><p>I never noticed the drawbacks and advantages of social media until I write this essay. I used to reckon that social media was just a software application which did not have huge connection with my normal life. However, during writing the essay, I really spent time thinking the nature of social media and searching information about it. In this process, I found that social media had so many advantages though there were also drawbacks. For example, I just realized that social media had been a main source of news and it was a major platform for me to communicate with others. In addition, from the research, I found that we had spent so much time on it, and we even did not realize it. As I mentioned above, writing this essay refreshed my understanding about social media. Also, by writing the essay, I have learnt a lot about how to write a formal academic paper. For example, I have to analyze my perspective completely and give evidence to fulfill my words. In terms of content, I realized that reference was really important as it can mark the source of my evidence, which was convenient for user to check the credibility of my writing. Last but not least in this part, I want to summarize the strength and weakness of my essay. In terms of strength, I introduce various of evidence to support my argument including statistic data and words of experts. Also, my analyze is objective so that my perspectives are unbiased. Regarding to weakness, I lack firsthand evidence because all evidence I introduced is either statistic data or experts’ words and there is no firsthand evidence given. In addition, I think my writing style is still a bit informal if I can use more academic words, my essay would have been better.</p>
<h1 id="Further-research"><a href="#Further-research" class="headerlink" title="Further research"></a>Further research</h1><p>As I mentioned above, I lack firsthand evidence to support my argument so, in the part of further research, I would like to design a survey and interview some of my classmates. In this process, I can get a more accurate and real-life evidence to support my argument. Also, if I have chance to interview foreign teenagers, my evidence will become more typical. There is one thing unknow, namely I cannot make sure whether the influence of social media to teenagers is unique and whether there is alternative product to replace social media. If there is no replacement, I can claim that social media is easily addicted as there is no replacement of it.</p>
