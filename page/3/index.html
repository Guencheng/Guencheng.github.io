<p>​     This is the second Math book I read in my high school year and the previous book is The joy of X. Actually, the general content of these two books are similar so I would not discuss about the content of this book instead I would like to talk about some traits of this book.</p>
<p>​     A famous scientist used to say that ‘You had better learn calculus as it is the language</p>
<p>of god’ I believe this sentence and calculus is really necessary in our daily life. You may not </p>
<p>see it directly and actually it is applicated nearly everywhere. From our phones to the whole </p>
<p>internet system, all places need calculus. I highlight the importance of calculus here again. In </p>
<p>this book, the writer also wants to highlight the importance of calculus so he introduced the </p>
<p>electromagnetic waves first, which is discovered with the help of calculus and is very </p>
<p>necessary to electronic devices. Then, the writer goes deeper and deeper to show us that</p>
<p> calculus is very interesting and important. This book also tells the knowledge of calculus in </p>
<p>the form of stories which is suitable for students to read. </p>
<p>​      I enjoy the story of the area of circle most because I think this is the greatest story to </p>
<p>introduce calculus and nearly all books about calculus would talk about it. The first reason is </p>
<p>the area of circle is simple. The second reason is the area of circle perfectly explain the </p>
<p>center idea of calculus.</p>
<p>​      Overall, this book is good. I think this book is deeper in calculus than the joy of X. The </p>
<p>joy of X is like the introduction of calculus and infinite powers is the applications of </p>
<p>calculus.</p>

<p>   On the thirteenth of August, I successfully finished my activity in X Academy. In these 12 days, I learnt both computer skills and learning skills. This article aims to discuss what I learn and what I thought in these 12 days.</p>
<p>​    First, I would like to discuss the people I saw in X Academy. The people that impressed me most were my academic leaders. I first met them in the hotel. One of them study in MIT and one of them study in Stanford. I was deeply surprised by their universities. Before, I thought these universities are far away from me. But now, I know that there are many powerful people around me and I need to learn from them. Another thought I got in these 12 days was that I need to widen my horizons. I mean, I can not just concentrate my view in my school. Maybe, in my school, I was not bad. However, if I widen my horizons to the whole world, I could find that there are still a lot for me to do. The people I met in X Academy had all kinds of personalities and they have their own strong points. They are also my competitors so I also need to compare them with me to make me better. Also, I found that there are so many good students in this day so I should think about how to make me stand out of them.</p>
<p>​    Secondly, it is about my learning skills. During these 12 days, the most useful thing I learnt was how to study by myself. Before, if I meet problems, I would ask my teachers for help. This is good obviously. However, I should know that teacher would not appear every time so I had to learn how to study alone. Before, my only path to solve difficult problems was to ask my teacher for help. But now, I can use the Internet as my another useful partner. Generally speaking, I can not depend on others to study any more, I have to learn to find resources and solve problems by myself.</p>

<p>​    Before I went to X Academy, I had to do some preparation for this activity to make sure that I could understand what teachers would say. My program in X Academy was called Data Science and I divided my preparation work into three parts – basic Math abilities, basic machine learning knowledge and basic applications of Python.</p>
<p>​    First, I would discuss Math anilities. Among Math abilities, I also divided it into three parts—functions, linear algebra and statistic. The reason why I needed to learn all kinds of functions was because, in data analysis, we may need to use function to calculate some values such as entropy. Additionally, functions are helpful when we learnt some principles of a model. Then, it was about linear algebra which was the most difficult part in Math abilities. However, it was also essential as Many models are based on linear algebra. Statistic was the most important part because we must use statistic models when we analyzed data such as using normal distribution.</p>
<p>​    Secondly, it was about machine learning. I did not need to know it in detail because I would learn it in my program. In the stage of preparation, I just need to learn what each model is like.</p>
<p>​    Last, I would talk about Python. This is the most essential part among my preparation as I would use Python to analyze data in my program. If I know little about it, it would be hard for me to write or read codes, which may make me fall behind the class.</p>

        <p>​                                                    My capstone of X Academy</p>
<p>​    In X Academy, everyone should do a project using what they learned here. In this article, I will discuss what I did in my capstone.</p>
<p>​    My program in X Academy was called Data Science so my capstone was related to processing data. I found my data set in a huge data set website called Kaggle. This data set was about the potability of water. It gave me a few properties of a kind of water such as ph, hardness, solids and I needed to use these properties to find whether this kind of water was potable.</p>
<p>​    First, I would show the first five rows of my data set.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/8f6c1cb22acc0a8e.jpg"> </p>
<p>​              By looking at the data, we could find that some data was lost in this data set so we needed to fill these lost data. The picture showed how many lost data are there in this data set.  </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/ad611dc7bd7b98bf.jpg"> </p>
<p>​    For this purpose, I chose to use the mean of the whole column to fill it as the mean of the whole column could make fewer errors. I took ph as example to show my codes.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/0a3c68cc954731a5.jpg"> </p>
<p>​             After dealing with lost data of ph, sulfate and trihalomethanes, all lost data was filled again.  </p>
<p>  <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/cafa4947ad1610b7.jpg">  </p>
<p>​             Besides lost data, we could also find that some data in this data set was very unreasonable. For example, the ph of a kind of water was 2 but the data set still said that this water was potable. To get an accurate result, we needed to drop these data. Take ph as example, we should know the right save range for ph first, which was 6 to 9. Then, we checked the ph values of all kinds of water one by one. If the ph of this kind of water was lower than 6 or higher than 9 and the data set still said it was potable, we would drop the whole row of this water as this row of data was unreasonable.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hb8C01"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hb8C01.jpg" alt="hb8C01.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​     After doing this, the whole data was cleaned completely. The next step was to choose a model to analyze my data. I would like to tell an interesting story in this step. At first, I did not realize that this was a classification question so I chose a lot of regression models which was a waste of time. However, maybe regression was not completely useless. If I rounded the value predicted by the regression model, I may get a result which was similar to that got from classification models. In fact, I tried many classification models but there was a problem. Many models predicted that all water was not potable in this data set. I checked my codes for many times and I was sure that my codes were correct so I thought this was the problem of the data set which means the values in this data set were not very correct. Finally, I decided to use decision tree as my classification as it can both output 1 and 2. The picture below was my code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hb8lAP"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hb8lAP.jpg" alt="hb8lAP.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​    So far, I had finished most of my code. The last step was to check the results predicted by my model. First, we can see that the accuracy of this model was only 77 precent which means the result of this model was not so good.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hb8M7t"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hb8M7t.jpg" alt="hb8M7t.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​    The picture above showed the specific result predicted by the model. We can find that, for potable water, the accuracy of my model was 50 precent. However, for unpotable water, the accuracy was 85 percent. So for this code, it had better be used to predict whether the water was unpotable instead of using it to predict whether the water was potable. In another words, if the model says the water is unpotable, you can trust it. However, if the model says the water is potable, you had better do not drink it.</p>

        <p>​                                                The report of Banqiao project (meeting 1)</p>
<p>​    On July 2, we went to Banqiao factory again. This time, we were able to take a look of a sample machine which was used to remove burrs on some particular components. Before this step was done by workers. However, the working environment of this job was very hard as this job was boring and workers would work in smoke. As a result, it was hard to employ workers and the cost of employing workers was high. To solve this problem, people wanted to use machine to replace most workers and just employed a few people to control it. In this article, I wanted to introduce the sample machine. Actually, the machine that I talked about this time was not the final product. It was just a sample to show how this kind of machine worked.</p>
<p>​    First, I wanted to show a general appearance of the sample machine.(figure1.1 1.2)</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/3c6ff6b47b3c3c96.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 1.1</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/3806f5ae229e73a3.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 1.2</p>
<p>​    Then, I would talk about it part by part. The first part was a holder to place components before machine worked. (figure 2.1) </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/35c213af8e02e7aa.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 2.1</p>
<p>​    In this holder, there were several supports to hold cylinder components. If the component had a different shape, we just needed to change the shape of supports and change the code of the machine. Under each support, there was a weight sensor which was used to check whether the component was placed well. Workers were needed to place components to the holder so workers could not be replaced completely. But this did not matter, the job was much better than the job which was needed to remove burrs.</p>
<p>​    The machine arm was also very important as cutters were fixed in this machine. It was the machine arm that controlled the components and put them towards the cutters. Moreover, burrs almost appeared on the same places of each component because burrs was caused by a few particular reasons which were same for all components. As a result, the machine arm just needed to repeat several steps. Also, you could find that the front part of the machine arm was much thinner as the part moved many times so it should be flexible. The latter part of the machine arm was much thicker as this part should be stable so that the whole machine would not shake easily. (figure 3.1)</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/b724c262c83ec72e.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 3.1</p>
<p>​    The last part was very simple – cutters and sand paper. Cutters were used to remove bigger burrs and sand paper was used to remove smaller burrs to make the component flatter. However, these two parts got broken easily so they were needed to be replaces regularly. (figure 4.1 – cutters) (figure 4.2 – sand paper) </p>

First, I would explain what was linear regression. For example, we had a set of data and we plotted it on a diagram just like figure 1.1.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbFLiq"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbFLiq.jpg" alt="hbFLiq.jpg"></a><br>Figure 1.1<br>​    And we wanted to predict the profit of the city which had a population of 23. We did not have the data directly but we could make sure that these data would follow a particular rule generally. If we could find the rule, we could predict the profit of a city with a population of 23. To achieve this, we used linear regression to draw a function just like figure 1.2 to represent the rule.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbk66U"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbk66U.jpg" alt="hbk66U.jpg"></a><br>figure 1.2<br>​    This was linear regression. When we have had a set of data in advance, we could use linear regression to calculate a function to represent the rule of this set of data.<br>​    Then, I wanted to introduce a new concept called Cost Function or Loss Function. Just like figure 1.1 and figure 1.2, we could find that the function that we calculated by linear regression could only represent the set of data generally. It was impossible to have function that could represent this kind of data perfectly. However, the function was useful, after all it could show a general rule and we could accept that there was some error. And Cost Function was used to show how much the error was. We calculated Cost Function in this way just like figure 2.1.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbkW79"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbkW79.jpg" alt="hbkW79.jpg"></a><br>Figure 2.1<br>​    After talking about linear regression and Cost function, I did a question. figure 3.1<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbACjS"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbACjS.jpg" alt="hbACjS.jpg"></a><br>figure 3.1<br>​    First, we needed to plot the data on a diagram. Figure 4.1. After plotting it, we could find that the data was a bit different from the example data that talked before. It was not linear. However, it did not matter. We still had method to deal with it. I would show two methods. One was done by me. The other was done by my classmate. These two methods were a bit different.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAn3V"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAn3V.jpg" alt="hbAn3V.jpg"></a><br>figure 4.1<br>​    First, I would show my method. Figure5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4<br>​    In figure 5.1, I defined some basic settings and introduced the data into the code.<br>​    In figure 5.2, I plotted the data.<br>​    In figure 5.3, I used linear regression to calculate the function.<br>​    In figure 5.4, I plotted the function.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAt9x"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAt9x.png" alt="hbAt9x.png"></a><br>figure 5.1<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbArEd"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbArEd.png" alt="hbArEd.png"></a><br>figure 5.2<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAy4I"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAy4I.png" alt="hbAy4I.png"></a><br>figure 5.3<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAIEj"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAIEj.png" alt="hbAIEj.png"></a><br>figure 5.4<br>​    Then, I would show the method of my classmate.

        <p>​                                                                   The joy of X (2)</p>
<p>​    This article is about the last four parts of this book – shape, change, data and future. Following the previous two parts—number and relationship, in this article, I will talk about my thoughts and questions.</p>
<p>​    In the third part—shape, The magic of circular core attracts me most because I seldom meet circular core. However, in the first several pages, there is totally no content related to circular core instead it tells a place called gallery of the echo(oval). At the same page, it also tells a new concept called parabola. Although these two things are not related to circular core, actually both of them are a part of circular core(These are related to some properties of circular core. If you are also interested in it, you can search it online. They are about how to cut a circular core.). This chapter is very clever because it explains circular core in such a practical and interesting way. Also, sine wave is mentioned. To be honest, sine wave is more useful than circular core because many things in this world even in this space all follow the rules of sine wave. However, it is very complex so I just give a short mention here(Actually, the sunset time, sunrise time and Big Bang are all related to sine wave).\</p>
<p>​    The fourth part is particularly essential because it is about calculus. We have to admit that calculus is very important in our science study, especially in Physics. Many Physics questions can not be worked out without calculus. Also, the concept of infinity is very essential. Broadly speaking, calculus can help us study the rate of change of object A related to object B so it can also help us to study some special situations, such as the largest number.</p>
<p>​    The fifth part is data or I can call it statistic. Broadly speaking, it is used to study the possibility of one particular thing happening. Or I can say it can predict the future. This concept is used in many areas, such as internet. You may find that, nowadays, internet may recommend some things to you. And strangely, you may really be interested in some of them. This is all based on data. It can predict what you want.</p>
<p>​    The last part is just about some interesting questions. If you are interested in it, you can read it by yourself. Because there is too much information in the last part, I do not want to talk about it seriously.</p>
<p>​    That is my whole thoughts about this book. I have to admit that this book is very good. It can attract you interest in studying Math. Also, it can widen my horizons in the area of Math. Ok, that is all.</p>

        <p>​                                                Reading feelings of The Joy of X</p>
<p>​    This book was recommended by my teacher. I was reading The Beauty of Math before I knew the book but The Beauty of Math was too hard for me to understand it. To make the reading more meaningful, I started reading The Joy of X. There is something similar between these two books. For example, they both explain that how important is Math in our daily life. The only difference is that The Beauty of Math concentrates on the aspect of Internet but The Joy of X concentrates on changing Math knowledge into real life situations. Also, there is something interesting. I found that these books all started from discussing the relationships between languages , tools and numbers as well as their histories. Maybe the discoveries of languages, tools and numbers are reasons why technology can develop so fast.</p>
<p>​    Then, I want to talk about what I really learnt from this book. The first is that I understand the importance of complex number. When I2 is equal to -1, we call I is complex number. As I thought before, complex number is meaningless because it does not exist in real life. However, after reading the book, I found that industry and engineering can not work without complex number in some particular situations. To summarize it, complex number can help to give some special orders when machines are working. Moreover, I learnt that one of the functions of Math is to make our life more convenient. I know that the digits which we are using today are called Arabic number but before we use Arabic number, there is a different number system called Roman number. The reason why we use Arabic number today instead of Roman number is that Roman number is nit convenient enough. For example, nine thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine expressed by Arabic number is 9999. However, if we use Roman number to express it, it will be MMMMMMMMMCMXCIX which is hard to recognize. Another example is the discovery of logarithm, it also make the expression of large numbers easier.</p>
<p>​    Overall, as the time flows, I will learn more and harder knowledge. However, the most important is that I have to learn how to use the knowledge in practice and application.</p>

<p>\1.  You’re taught by experts in your field through a combination of lectures, practicals (where relevant), seminars, and regular small-group tuition known as ‘supervision’. These allow you to explore course material in much greater depth, investigate new approaches, receive regular feedback and clarify anything you’re unsure about. (why Cambridge)</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>   <strong>University is about</strong> <strong>trying new things.</strong> <strong>(social life)</strong></p>
<p>\3.   Your time at Cambridge isn’t just about academic work – Cambridge will be your home for the duration of your course and it’s important that you have time out from your studies and get involved in all the opportunities the University and city have to offer. (student’s union)</p>
<p>\4.   Cambridge students are typically ambitious, intelligent, motivated, hard-working, passionate, committed, curious, intellectually creative, independent thinkers, and able to manage their time effectively. (career)</p>
<p>\5.   It allows you to keep your options open while equipping you with all the analytical, design and computing skills that underpin modern engineering practice. (course)</p>
<p>\6.   We also have strong links with industry, with many research projects funded by industrial companies. (course)</p>
<p>\7.   You’re required to complete six weeks of industrial experience by the end of the third year, obtained by deferring entry or during vacations. (course)</p>
<p>\8.   Teaching is provided through a mixture of lectures, practicals, projects and supervisions, and in Year 1 you can typically expect around 22 hours of teaching each week. You’re assessed each year through coursework and written exams. (course)</p>
<p>\9.   The broad foundation of the first two years (Part I) gives you an understanding of the basic principles of a wide range of subjects, together with an appreciation of the external pressures under which these ideas are likely to be applied. (course)</p>
<p>\10.  You also undertake several coursework activities and projects, on topics including structural design, product design, presentation skills, drawing, laboratory experiments and computer programming. (course)</p>
<p>\11.  A highlight of the year is the compulsory integrated design project where you work in teams to design and build robot vehicles which are then tested against each other. (course)</p>
<p>\12.  In addition, you take an Extension Activity(selected from several topics, including both non-technical options, such as a language course, and technical options designed to introduce you to various measurement and test procedures in your chosen professional area) and, in the final term, choose two from a variety of design and computer-based projects or projects in a foreign language. (course)</p>
<p>\13.  Many projects are associated with current Department research and have direct industrial input and application. (course) </p>
<p>\14.  Many lecturers are leading academics working at the forefront of their field, so lectures are a fantastic opportunity to find out about the latest research. (course)</p>
<p>\15.  provide the opportunity to discuss particular topics in more detail. They’re led by academics but you’re expected to contribute actively. (course)</p>
<p>\16.  Practical work on some courses may be assessed. (course)</p>
<p>\17.  A chance to carry out your own research, test out theories and put forward your own ideas. Your work might even get published while you’re still an undergraduate. (course)</p>
<p>\18.  <strong>We admit the most academically able and motivated students and provide them with inspiring, world class teaching**</strong>. (course)**</p>
<p>​                                                                                     刚需材料</p>
<p>\1.   成绩 A<em>A</em>A</p>
<p>- Applicants have generally achieved high grades in subjects relevant to their chosen course, and most students who apply have at least four or five 7/8/9s at GCSE (an A is considered equivalent to 7 and an A* is considered equivalent to 8/9). However, there are always exceptions and we don’t require a minimum number of 7/8/9s at GCSE. One of the strengths of the Cambridge admissions system is its ability to assess all applicants individually. （GCSE）</p>
<p>- The typical conditional A Level offer will be A<em>AA or A</em>A<em>A, depending on the course. In countries where an A</em> grade at A Level is not available, three A grades would be acceptable.Some applicants may be set lower offers or more challenging ones. Applicants may be required to achieve A* in a particular subject(s) depending on individual circumstances. (AS&amp;ALEVEL)</p>
<p>- Applicants taking four subjects won’t normally be at an advantage compared with those taking three. (AS&amp;ALEVEL)</p>
<p>- the combination of A Level subjects, the grade achieved in the early A Level, and your engagement with other relevant subjects in Year 13 in and beyond the classroom. (AS&amp;ALEVEL)</p>
<p>- At Cambridge, students are regularly assessed by examination and there’s no opportunity to resit any exams (with the exception of professional qualifying examinations in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/medicine">Medicine</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/courses/veterinary-medicine">Veterinary Medicine</a>). Therefore, we would be concerned about an applicant who is retaking large numbers of exams. (AS&amp;ALEVEL)</p>
<p>- Further Mathematics is very strongly encouraged. (course)</p>
<p>-We accept a wide variety of qualifications from all over the world and expect students to be achieving the highest grades – most successful applicants ultimately exceed the conditions of their offer. (course)</p>
<p>\2. 雅思</p>
<p>-<strong>IELTS Academic</strong>1 – normally a minimum overall grade of 7.5, usually with 7.0 or above in each element</p>

        <p>First, I want to talk about my original intentions to learn physical science. Since I was in my middle school, I have been interested in Physics, Chemistry and Maths. The most important two points that these subjects attract me is that I can explore the different relationships among different matters and I can look for the natures of different phenomenons. Moreover, many techniques today are based on physical science so, if I want to get an ideal job, the knowledge of physical science is very essential. Then, I would like to tell you about why I am an ideal student in this area. The first I want to mention is that my strong interest in this subject will make me keep working hard in this area. Also, I have had many important qualifications required in this area. For example, I am always keen to try new things and I love innovation. What’s more, I will not just pay attention to academic work. For my perspective, all things around the world are worth studying. And I always prefer to link my academic work with practical applications. During my normal study, I pay a lot attention to experiments because I reckon experiment will reflect the most real situations. </p>
