<p>Question: A person wants to buy some milk tea with 500 dollar and he wants to spend all of the money. How to write a code to find the solution that the man can buy as much milk tea as possible and there is no repetitive taste.</p>
<p>For this question, the first and the most tuff work for me is to input all data about milk tea which costs me a lot of time. Also, we need to define a new data type that can store the name of milk tea and its price together. Then, we have to order it with descending the price to make it more convenient for us to write code. I would just show part of the code to input data and the code to order milk tea.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/abb47637d8d9d6cf.jpg"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/322e106b54a353c2.jpg"> </p>
<p>Then, we need to find the solution to select most milk tea. To buy as much milk tea as possible, we need to buy more cheaper milk tea. My idea is to add all milk tea from cheapest to most expensive one by one until it first exceeds or is equal to 500 dollar. If it is 500 dollar, that is wonderful because there will not be any better solution but the real situation is that it exceeds 500 dollar. Then, the most important step comes. We should remove the last milk tea added as it is extra. After removing it, we can find that there is a gap between 500 dollar and our list so we should replace the last milk tea in our current list and we need a milk tea with a price which is equal to the gap plus the price of the milk tea we removed. In this part, a simple loop search is used and then the question is solved. Here is my code:</p>

<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/4791e906dce7b4ff.jpg"> </p>
<p>And the final answer is 27:</p>

        <p>How to use python to fit a curve</p>
<p>This is a very meaningful topic as in engineering we might meet a lot of data and we need a curve to fit the data to get the trend. First, before we start we need a data to be fitted. Because I do not have data that can be used so I have to make up some data. I generate a data about the equation (x-2)(x-8)(x-5)+ 10. To make it more difficult, I will give some percentage error to it.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/b0b5aeddd3b31bd8.jpg"> </p>
<p>Then, with the data, we can start fit it. First, we need a model and I will use a library called curve_fit to help me. In this library, you just need to input the data and it will return the parameter you needed for you. With the parameter, we can draw a diagraph again to check whether it works. Here, I will the result.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/c38fc0851d37666b.jpg"> </p>
<p>The blue line is original data and the orange line is the data we fit. It is clearly shown that the library works well. For the blue line, there are some bends as we set percentage error. For the orange line, it is very smooth.</p>

<p>Question: There are two numbers A and B. How many situations are there so that the number A0B mode AB = 0?</p>
<p>While this is originally a math problem so there must be tips to do it. However, computer is good at doing repetitive work so writing a code is also a fantastic method to do it. I would explain my thoughts then I would show my code. First, we need to build two arrays – one for A and one for B. Also, we need to define a new data type to store A and B together. In the main program, we should write a nested loop. If A and B satisfy this condition, we store it into the result array. Finally, we just need to output the result.</p>

        <p>The technology of chip</p>
<p>\1.    What is chip:</p>
<p>n Chip = semiconductor + integrated circuit</p>
<p>n Chip is weak so it is needed to be protected in a shell</p>
<p>n In chips, there are wires, some are responsible for supplying electricity, some are responsible for input and output.</p>
<p>n Kind of chips: CPU(logic chip), WiFi(communication chip), memory(memory chip)</p>
<p>\2.    Why semiconductors:</p>
<p>n Before semiconductor can be used, people use machine to control electricity physically, but with semiconductor, people use electricity to control electricity.</p>
<p>n With the application of electricity, people go into the electrical world.</p>
<p>n Quantum physics contributes to the application of semiconductor which can switch from conductor to isolator or from isolator to conductor.</p>
<p>n Semiconductor takes people from electrical world to electronic world.</p>
<p>n Use electricity to control electricity increase the speed of information interaction significantly. </p>
<p>\3.    Why integrated circuit:</p>
<p>n Only semiconductor is not enough, many semiconductors work together to realize a function so integrated circuit is needed to connect them.</p>
<p>n But why integrated circuit, why do not we just melt them together? Many components make a circuit very huge, but with integrated circuit, chip can be made very small and complex.</p>
<p>n All questions of chips can be broken into 0 and 1.</p>
<p>n To deal with more information or get a greater speed, we need more semiconductors and, as area is limited, so we need to connect as many semiconductors as possible in a fixed area.</p>
<p>\4.    Chip connects the world of analogue and the world of digits</p>
<p>n For example, how do we measure force before? – Newton meter. But now, we have force sensor.</p>
<p>n Chips can transfer information of real life into digital form and it can be sent quickly, calculating quickly and stored for a long time.</p>
<p>n So now, nearly all physical quantity can be transferred into digital world. (force, heat, sound, light and electricity)</p>
<p>\5.    Question :</p>
<p>What kind of interaction can not be replaced by chips?</p>
<p>n My perspectives, mental feelings can not replaced by chips. For example, do you want chips to eat food for you and transfer energy back to you? Of course not, because in this case, result just consists of 50%. The other 50% is the process you eat the food.</p>
<p>\6.    Why chips:</p>
<p>n Chip is perfect performer of digital information</p>
<p>n 1. Why electronic but not machines: controlling electrons is much faster</p>
<p>n 2. Why not vacuum tubes: chips are not easy to be broken but vacuum tubes did. And in the application, any small error can not happen or a huge trouble will be caused. In the design and production of chips, purity of silico and the precise of board are strictly controlled, which makes chips very precise. In short, chips are reliable.</p>
<p>n 3. Chips are innovated very quickly.</p>
<p>n For chips, its needs and technology are proportional to each other. If chips are better, more needs come. if more needs come, this will push chips to be innovated.</p>
<p>\7.    The theory limit of chips:</p>
<p>n Moore’s law: Every 18 months, the number of transistors in a unit area will be doubled. </p>
<p>n To produce chips with stronger performance, the quality and quantity of transistors are needed to be improved.</p>
<p>n There is distance between transistors and that is why Moore’s law is valid. </p>
<p>n The diameter of a silicon atom is 0.2 nm and this distance can not be shorter as silicon atoms can not be changed.</p>
<p>n The diameter of silicon atoms is just one of the factors. The other two are quantum physics and thermodynamics. </p>
<p>n Thermodynamics: silicon atoms are not stationary so their motion might prevent some electrons moving. When we decrease the distance between transistors, the number of electrons is smaller and the problem of thermodynamics will be more significantly. So temperature is a problem.</p>
<p>n Quantum physics: A phenomenon called quantum tunneling is a problem. </p>
<p>n Quantum tunneling: Even transistors are not opened, a very small amount of electrons can still pass over. When transistors are closer, the probability of quantum tunneling is greater. </p>
<p>n All above, that is just the problems of a transistor. In integrated circuit, there are many and more problems are met.</p>
<p>n Also, as chips work, much heat will be produced so how to remove the heat is important. For normal pc, wind is enough. For super computer, water is needed.</p>
<p>n There is something interesting: all above we are discussing is silicon transistor. Maybe different materials might be used and many problems might be overcomed at that time.</p>

<p>\1.    BCI is trying to replacing language, which means with the help of BCI, people can communicate with others directly including people and hardware.</p>
<p>\2.    The improvement of technology not only depends on creation but also depends on the combination of current technology.</p>
<p>\3.    Sometimes, the improvement of technology will not be limited by theory, it might go further than theory. For example, we first meet some problems or phenominums then we introduce new theory to explain or solve it.</p>

        <p>​                                                   An introduction of window program</p>
<p>When I write codes, I always wonder that how others can use my code, especially for those who do not know much about Python. If they know little about Python, they even do not know how to run a single instruction. So I have to make my program more kind which means I have to improve the interactivity of my program. To achieve this purpose, I decide to introduce window program. In window program, there is button and displaying screen. By using this component, users can understand the purpose of the code better because tips can be written in the button or screen. For example, if I write a ‘plus 1’ on the button, users will know that if they click on the button, a number will plus 1.  Here is an example. First, I will show my original codes</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/d8baca2fbd3444ea.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/fc8f296435b91c4e.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/2bc3cd327d8f2e51.jpg"> </p>
<p>If you know little about Python, of course this is confusing. You will not know that to run this code you have to input ‘pickones()’ which is a fuction. But if I turn this code into window program.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/3d0feedde72f342e.png"> </p>
<p>It is more clear right? There is a button on the bottom of the left side called ‘pickone’, when users see this, they will know clicking the button can pick one. In another word, they know to run the code, they need to click the button. And the displaying screen is on the right of the button so that they can see the result. The background code of the window is shown below(use tkinter).</p>

        <p>This time, the task is about how to use regression to predict the price of second-hand car through some properties of the car. First of all, we should introduce some function to Python which has to been done every time. In addition, the dataset should be downloaded here. </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/3bb4f5f85bfa85ef.png"> </p>
<p>This dataset has 31 rows including SaleID, 15 known properties and 15 unknown properties. Unknown properties are expressed by V.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/bea4e0cc979c7545.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9e4387b8cda76031.png"> </p>
<p>  Then, in the regression, SaleID and name of the cars are useless properties which should be dropped or the accuracy of the result may be affected.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/2f9cd6386ed91a79.png"> </p>
<p>  There is another annoying point. The row of price is between the rows of known properties and the rows of unknown properties so we have to put price in the first row which is convenient for us to separate price and properties.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/540cfc8e67e7f000.png"> </p>
<p>  Next step is to separate test dataset and train dataset as well as price and properties. However, it is strange that unknown properties are all indicated by strings so we need to change the data type of unknown properties. The code with red line is what I did to solve this problem. </p>
<p>  <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/680a10c68fab539c.png"> </p>
<p> Finally, the most important step, use Linear Regression to train the data.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/713d7c3c59a05127.png"> </p>
<p> So far, all steps are done but we also need to test how well is the model trained. Here, I add the absolute difference of all trained value and all real value and then divide them by the total number. The final error is 2840 yuan. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p> After I learnt some basic knowledge about Arduino, I did a remote-controlled car with the help of some videos on the Internet and this is a record of how I made this car. The whole record will be broken into two parts. The first part aims to show how I put different pieces together and the second part will the codes used in this car.</p>
<p>  This is the part of putting pieces together. First I will show the final product.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/3e2f39194ca70208.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9296c887ceedb909.png"> </p>
<p>The whole car can be broken into three parts. Next, I will introduce them one by one.</p>
<p>——Mainboard</p>
<p>  Mainboard is the most difficult part to weld because there are so many small pieces in it. Before we weld it, it is empty.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/881812d638e3e8d7.png"> </p>
<p> After I weld it, it is filled with small components.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/f901913cf3281eb0.png"> </p>
<p> We can know what to weld by looking at the tips on the empty board. There are many patterns on the empty board and just find the component that follows the pattern. Do not forget that some components have positive and negative sides. And fix component well before you weld it or it will look ugly.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9b21f01a797d0946.png"> </p>
<p> After welding small pieces , we should put the mainboard and UNO board together and fix them to the bottom board of the car.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/d5661acc3c0e3502.png"> </p>
<p>——Sensor part</p>
<p>  Sensor part aims to achieve some functions of this car such as making the car move following a path and making the car avoid barriers automatically. First, following path is achieve by a infra-red</p>
<p>sensor. It can emit infra-red light and receive the reflected light to determine the color of the road.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/a3af0453a0cd1496.png"> </p>
<p> The next part is avoiding barriers. The principle of this part is similar to that of following path. It also used infers-red light to calculate the distance between barrier and it self to avoid barrier.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/44ae1a01124b1ed2.png"> </p>
<p>——battery and wheel part</p>
<p>  This is the most easy part to do because there is no special tips in this part. However, it is the most important part because it is the power of the whole car.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/71faa7a2b56b20ea.png"> </p>
<p> That is all for the three parts and finally we just need to connect wires between different parts.</p>

        <p>​    Recently, I read a new book called “Critical thinking and writing”. So far, I am interested in a topic called “Argument” in this book. When people write academic paper or articles, argument is hard to avoid so how to write a complete and good argument is really necessary. </p>
<p>​    First, what is argument should be indicated. Argument is made of three parts—precondition, reason and conclusion. Second, when does argument appear. My answer is ‘question’. If people have different opinions or confuse about a question, argument will exist because argument aims to express an ideal logically and clearly. To achieve this, a good reason is necessary because other people will depend on the reason to determine whether you are right. And for all reasons, it must be objective. “Objective” means that the reason is suitable for nearly all situations not just one person’s feeling.</p>
