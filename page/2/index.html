        <p>Java practice one</p>
<p>Question: There are two numbers A and B. How many situations are there so that the number A0B mode AB = 0?</p>
<p>While this is originally a math problem so there must be tips to do it. However, computer is good at doing repetitive work so writing a code is also a fantastic method to do it. I would explain my thoughts then I would show my code. First, we need to build two arrays – one for A and one for B. Also, we need to define a new data type to store A and B together. In the main program, we should write a nested loop. If A and B satisfy this condition, we store it into the result array. Finally, we just need to output the result.</p>

<p>The final answer is three:</p>

        <p>The technology of chip</p>
<p>\1.    What is chip:</p>
<p>n Chip = semiconductor + integrated circuit</p>
<p>n Chip is weak so it is needed to be protected in a shell</p>
<p>n In chips, there are wires, some are responsible for supplying electricity, some are responsible for input and output.</p>
<p>n Kind of chips: CPU(logic chip), WiFi(communication chip), memory(memory chip)</p>
<p>\2.    Why semiconductors:</p>
<p>n Before semiconductor can be used, people use machine to control electricity physically, but with semiconductor, people use electricity to control electricity.</p>
<p>n With the application of electricity, people go into the electrical world.</p>
<p>n Quantum physics contributes to the application of semiconductor which can switch from conductor to isolator or from isolator to conductor.</p>
<p>n Semiconductor takes people from electrical world to electronic world.</p>
<p>n Use electricity to control electricity increase the speed of information interaction significantly. </p>
<p>\3.    Why integrated circuit:</p>
<p>n Only semiconductor is not enough, many semiconductors work together to realize a function so integrated circuit is needed to connect them.</p>
<p>n But why integrated circuit, why do not we just melt them together? Many components make a circuit very huge, but with integrated circuit, chip can be made very small and complex.</p>
<p>n All questions of chips can be broken into 0 and 1.</p>
<p>n To deal with more information or get a greater speed, we need more semiconductors and, as area is limited, so we need to connect as many semiconductors as possible in a fixed area.</p>
<p>\4.    Chip connects the world of analogue and the world of digits</p>
<p>n For example, how do we measure force before? – Newton meter. But now, we have force sensor.</p>
<p>n Chips can transfer information of real life into digital form and it can be sent quickly, calculating quickly and stored for a long time.</p>
<p>n So now, nearly all physical quantity can be transferred into digital world. (force, heat, sound, light and electricity)</p>
<p>\5.    Question :</p>
<p>What kind of interaction can not be replaced by chips?</p>
<p>n My perspectives, mental feelings can not replaced by chips. For example, do you want chips to eat food for you and transfer energy back to you? Of course not, because in this case, result just consists of 50%. The other 50% is the process you eat the food.</p>
<p>\6.    Why chips:</p>
<p>n Chip is perfect performer of digital information</p>
<p>n 1. Why electronic but not machines: controlling electrons is much faster</p>
<p>n 2. Why not vacuum tubes: chips are not easy to be broken but vacuum tubes did. And in the application, any small error can not happen or a huge trouble will be caused. In the design and production of chips, purity of silico and the precise of board are strictly controlled, which makes chips very precise. In short, chips are reliable.</p>
<p>n 3. Chips are innovated very quickly.</p>
<p>n For chips, its needs and technology are proportional to each other. If chips are better, more needs come. if more needs come, this will push chips to be innovated.</p>
<p>\7.    The theory limit of chips:</p>
<p>n Moore’s law: Every 18 months, the number of transistors in a unit area will be doubled. </p>
<p>n To produce chips with stronger performance, the quality and quantity of transistors are needed to be improved.</p>
<p>n There is distance between transistors and that is why Moore’s law is valid. </p>
<p>n The diameter of a silicon atom is 0.2 nm and this distance can not be shorter as silicon atoms can not be changed.</p>
<p>n The diameter of silicon atoms is just one of the factors. The other two are quantum physics and thermodynamics. </p>
<p>n Thermodynamics: silicon atoms are not stationary so their motion might prevent some electrons moving. When we decrease the distance between transistors, the number of electrons is smaller and the problem of thermodynamics will be more significantly. So temperature is a problem.</p>
<p>n Quantum physics: A phenomenon called quantum tunneling is a problem. </p>
<p>n Quantum tunneling: Even transistors are not opened, a very small amount of electrons can still pass over. When transistors are closer, the probability of quantum tunneling is greater. </p>
<p>n All above, that is just the problems of a transistor. In integrated circuit, there are many and more problems are met.</p>
<p>n Also, as chips work, much heat will be produced so how to remove the heat is important. For normal pc, wind is enough. For super computer, water is needed.</p>
<p>n There is something interesting: all above we are discussing is silicon transistor. Maybe different materials might be used and many problems might be overcomed at that time.</p>

<h1 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1><p>As the technology develops, social media is becoming more and more popular among young people. Social media is often indicated as a virtual platform for creation or sharing resources. As a result, people can benefit from using social media because it is easier for them to access the resources from others to activate their own creations. In addition, because teenagers can share information on social media, it is also a proper platform for teenagers to maintain or expend their relationships with others. However, many problems are also caused by social media as the result of its virtuality which means there may be much fake or wrong information. For example, social media might cause addiction and teenagers might accept misleading information on social media.</p>
<h1 id="Thesis-statement"><a href="#Thesis-statement" class="headerlink" title="Thesis statement"></a>Thesis statement</h1><p>This article aims to analyze the effect of social media to teenagers in both positive and negative sides and discuss whether teenagers should use social media. Regarding my research, the benefits brought by social media to teenagers has exceeded the damage that it can cause.</p>
<h1 id="Benefits"><a href="#Benefits" class="headerlink" title="Benefits"></a>Benefits</h1><h2 id="Boosting-productivity-and-creativity"><a href="#Boosting-productivity-and-creativity" class="headerlink" title="Boosting productivity and creativity"></a>Boosting productivity and creativity</h2><p>Social media can boost the productivity and creativity of teenagers by using social media because social media is a platform for sharing resources. For example, teenagers can send messages to their friends, and they can see what the recent situations of their friends if they post it. According to the article (IOM, 2021), it is indicated that students may have a greater academic success with the help of social media. Teenagers can search information about their concerns or questions. By analyzing the information, their concerns may be solved, and they may have new ideas by combining the ideas of different resources. In addition, teenagers can discuss with other people by using social media. From the discussion, they can complete their own ideas and they may have the chance to access the thoughts of others which they do not think about before to improve their creativity. Additionally, if teenagers can compare their opinions with those from others, they can build a sense of critical thinking as communicating with others can help them think from different perspectives. In terms of evidence, this paragraph introduces a paper from an expert in this area and the evidence strongly proves the argument. With regard to its neutrality, the explanation is very objective. It does not show vested interest. However, this paragraph still needs some other kinds of evidence, such as data evidence. This paragraph is objective, and the evidence of this paragraph is strong. This paragraph could have been better if more various evidence can be used. </p>
<h2 id="Expanding-relationship"><a href="#Expanding-relationship" class="headerlink" title="Expanding relationship"></a>Expanding relationship</h2><p>Social media is beneficial for teenagers to expand their relationship with others. From a website (Dimock, 2021), it is indicated that over 94% of teenagers spend time chatting with their friends on social media. Teenagers can communicate with others on social media and make friends with them. For example, they may meet people who share the same interest. By chatting with them, people may become more familiar with each other. As a result, friendship is built between teenagers. Compared with previous generation, if previous people wanted to keep in touch with others, they had to write letters, which was very slow and inconvenient. With the help of social media, geographical limit can be broken, nearly all messages can be sent to its destinate on time quickly. Furthermore, the people that teenagers meet may come from all over the world which means teenagers can make friends without the limitation of geographic position and teenagers can learn foreign cultures and foreign knowledge from their foreign people. Also, by chatting with friends, teenagers will not feel lonely on social media because, as soon as they feel bored or lonely, they can find someone to talk on social media. In terms of structure, this paragraph does not contain counter argument, but this article mentions some negative opinions in other paragraphs. The evidence of this paragraph is strong because it is a fact in the form of data. This paragraph is strong because of its reasonable evidence and objective explanation.</p>
<h2 id="Expanding-horizons"><a href="#Expanding-horizons" class="headerlink" title="Expanding horizons"></a>Expanding horizons</h2><p>Social media contributes to expand the horizons of teenagers. A website (Steyer, 2020) indicates that 54% of teenagers get news from social media. On social media, there is a large amount of news and daily reports. By reading them, teenagers can access to know what is happening that day. Also, there is no geographical limitation on social media, which means teenagers can access foreign information. By accessing the information from all over the world, their perspectives will not be limited in their living environment instead they can build an international version learning and understanding foreign cultures and learn things that they never see before. In addition, normally, on social media, different people have different opinions on the same event. By comparing the ideas of different people, it is helpful for teenagers to develop critical thinking. The evidence of this paragraph is strong as it uses data as a fact to prove its argument. However, this article concentrates too much on data evidence. It should also pay attention to the words of experts in this area. Though this paragraph is positive to social media, it still explains the argument objectively. This paragraph shows no vested interest and the evidence to this paragraph is closely related to the topic.</p>
<h1 id="Drawbacks"><a href="#Drawbacks" class="headerlink" title="Drawbacks"></a>Drawbacks</h1><h2 id="Causing-mental-problems"><a href="#Causing-mental-problems" class="headerlink" title="Causing mental problems"></a>Causing mental problems</h2><p>Social media may cause mental problems among teenagers. From (Pack, 2021), it is indicated that over half of teenagers have been bullied online. Peerayuth (Peerayuth, 2018) indicates that social media may cause psychological problems, such as envy, in teenagers. Social media is a virtual platform so there is a large amount of fake information. Some people may post fake information about their life on the internet to show how well they are living. However, other people may not know the reality of information. As a result, they may think that they have fallen behind others which could cause depression, anxiety and envy. In addition, because of the virtuality of social media, it may lack of regulation so teenagers may suffer from cyber bullying and cyber fraud, which are also harmful for the development of psychology of teenagers. Additionally, on social media, there is nearly no regulation for teenagers so that they can do whatever they want on social media which might build harmful habits. For example, because teenagers are not regulated on social media, they might be self-willed in real life. Also, on social media, there might be something that attracts tanagers so much which cannot be got in real life. As a result, teenagers might escape themselves from real life and lose themselves on the virtual world built by social media. In terms of credibility, this author shows no vested interest, so it is believable. Also, there are both data evidence and essay evidence for this argument, so evidence are strong, such as 50% of teenagers are bullied and Peerayuth (2018). Furthermore, about structure, there is no inferential gap, and this article is objective and balanced. This paragraph is believable because of its neutrality, credibility and balanced structure</p>
<h2 id="Spreading-of-misleading-information"><a href="#Spreading-of-misleading-information" class="headerlink" title="Spreading of misleading information"></a>Spreading of misleading information</h2><p>There is misleading information in social media. Social media is a virtual platform so teenagers can access any information on the Internet, which means both helpful and misleading information may be spread. Normally, teenagers lack the ability to identify the property of information as they are not as mature as adults. Grant (Gross, 2018) has indicated that, in social media, fake news spread much faster than that you can imagine. As a result, if teenagers meet some harmful information, they may be misled. For example, there are many websites about sex and gambling on social media. If teenagers visit these websites and believe them, teenagers may be led to a wrong direction. It may cause both health and mental problems, even crime might be caused. Also, the spread of this kind of information is hard to regulate which means there is nearly no solution to prevent it from happening so the best solution is teaching teenagers identifying right and wrong as early as possible. This argument is very weak. First of all, there is only one evidence to support this argument. As a result, the credibility of the argument is low. Also, this argument is not balanced, it only focuses on the negative information of social media. However, the explanation of this argument is objective. This argument could be better. It can improve its evidence and it can add a counter argument for this argument.</p>
<h2 id="Causing-addiction"><a href="#Causing-addiction" class="headerlink" title="Causing addiction"></a>Causing addiction</h2><p>Social media may cause addiction among teenagers, which means teenagers may concentrate less on their studies. From Steyer (Steyer, 2020), it is indicated that 92% of teenagers go online every day and 24% say that they go online constantly. Also, 59% of parents say that they feel their kids are addicted to social media. Hou (Yubo, 2019) indicates that social media addiction may negatively affect the mental health and academic performance of teenagers. There are various functions on social media, such as watching videos and playing games. These kinds of functions may cause strong satisfaction among teenagers because teenagers can get what they cannot access on these functions. As a result, addiction may be caused because teenagers may feel more comfortable to using social media rather than doing their works. This may waste the time of teenagers on social media and cause teenagers to fall their works or studies behind. Also, spending too much time on social media may harm the health of teenagers, such as their eyes. Furthermore, if teenagers are addicted to social media, when they do their own works, they may concern their social media from time to time, which may reduce their concentration. In terms of evidence, this paragraph is strong as there are both data evidence and essay evidence from experts in this area and the evidence are closely related to the topic, which means there is no inferential gap. In terms of credibility, the author shows no vested interest. However, it does not mention counter argument in this paragraph so it could be more balanced. Regarding credibility, evidence and structure, this argument is strong and believable. However, it could have been better if counter argument is mentioned.</p>
<h1 id="The-comparison-of-both-perspectives"><a href="#The-comparison-of-both-perspectives" class="headerlink" title="The comparison of both perspectives"></a>The comparison of both perspectives</h1><h2 id="Perspective-one"><a href="#Perspective-one" class="headerlink" title="Perspective one"></a>Perspective one</h2><p>Three benefits are mentioned in perspective1 - boosting productivity, expanding relationship and widening horizons. For the first argument about productivity, there is no inferential gap, the evidence which is an article indicating students may have greater academic success with the help of social media is related to the topic. However, the credibility of the evidence is weak because it did not mention the author of the argument and the evidence did not demonstrate the exact quantitative evidence. Also, this evidence did not list reasons. The evidence of the second argument about expanding relationship is much stronger than the first one, which is a website demonstrating 94% of teenagers spend time chatting on social media. The source website is indicated, and it shows quantitative data. Also, the website is an authorized one. However, there is a slight inference gap of it because chatting on social media does not mean expansion of relationship directly. Teenagers chatting on social media may just communicate with their familiar friends instead of making friends with others so the topic of the second argument can be changed to expansion and maintenance of the relationship. The evidence of the third argument which indicates 54% of teenagers get news from social media is quite similar with that of the second one. There is a problem related to these two arguments, namely they lack the statement of experts in this area to support them. In short, almost all evidence in perspective one is related to their topics, but the common problems they face are the variety of evidence and credibility.</p>
<h2 id="Perspective-two"><a href="#Perspective-two" class="headerlink" title="Perspective two"></a>Perspective two</h2><p>Three opinions are mentioned in the second perspective, they are causing mental problems, spreading misleading information and addiction among teenagers. The first argument is credible as it both demonstrates statistical data and words from experts in its evidence and its evidence are quite strong and have a clear source. In addition, there is no inferential gap in the first opinion and the author explains clearly with accurate logic. However, the second opinion is not as credible as the first one. It only has one evidence to support its words, which leads to weakness. But the explanation is quite convincing because it gives example to support its content. The opinion could have been better if more convincing evidence are given. The third opinion with regard to addiction is quite strong. It gives credible evidence as the evidence contain both statistical data and words from authorized people in this area and all evidence give clear sources. In its explanation, it gives exact objects that can cause addiction and it analyses the reasons of addiction, which is convincing.</p>
<h2 id="Comparison"><a href="#Comparison" class="headerlink" title="Comparison"></a>Comparison</h2><p>Both perspective one and perspective two have advantages and disadvantages. However, generally, perspective two shows greater credibility as its evidence are more various and more convincing, and it both gives statistical data and words from experts. Also, its explanation is more objective. The only problem is that one of its opinions lack enough evidences.</p>
<h1 id="The-conclusion"><a href="#The-conclusion" class="headerlink" title="The conclusion"></a>The conclusion</h1><p>From my perspectives, though social media has its drawbacks, the general influence of social media to teenagers is beneficial. For those drawbacks, they can be reduced or solved by technology methods. For example, if teenagers are addicted to games or any other entertainment software, their parents can set the time limit for their children, or the government can develop policies to limit assess time of specific software such as games to teenagers. Similar policies have been set in China and it has worked successfully. In addition, under the influence of COVID-19, it is hard for teenagers to go outside freely as before and many of them are even forced to have online lessons. As a result, social media plays a more and more important role in teenagers’ life, only as a study tool but also as a platform to communicate with others so I reckon that the advantages of social media exceed its disadvantages and teenagers should take the advantage of social media to improve them and fulfill their social life in such as special period.</p>
<h1 id="Reflection-and-evaluation"><a href="#Reflection-and-evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Reflection and evaluation"></a>Reflection and evaluation</h1><p>I never noticed the drawbacks and advantages of social media until I write this essay. I used to reckon that social media was just a software application which did not have huge connection with my normal life. However, during writing the essay, I really spent time thinking the nature of social media and searching information about it. In this process, I found that social media had so many advantages though there were also drawbacks. For example, I just realized that social media had been a main source of news and it was a major platform for me to communicate with others. In addition, from the research, I found that we had spent so much time on it, and we even did not realize it. As I mentioned above, writing this essay refreshed my understanding about social media. Also, by writing the essay, I have learnt a lot about how to write a formal academic paper. For example, I have to analyze my perspective completely and give evidence to fulfill my words. In terms of content, I realized that reference was really important as it can mark the source of my evidence, which was convenient for user to check the credibility of my writing. Last but not least in this part, I want to summarize the strength and weakness of my essay. In terms of strength, I introduce various of evidence to support my argument including statistic data and words of experts. Also, my analyze is objective so that my perspectives are unbiased. Regarding to weakness, I lack firsthand evidence because all evidence I introduced is either statistic data or experts’ words and there is no firsthand evidence given. In addition, I think my writing style is still a bit informal if I can use more academic words, my essay would have been better.</p>
<h1 id="Further-research"><a href="#Further-research" class="headerlink" title="Further research"></a>Further research</h1><p>As I mentioned above, I lack firsthand evidence to support my argument so, in the part of further research, I would like to design a survey and interview some of my classmates. In this process, I can get a more accurate and real-life evidence to support my argument. Also, if I have chance to interview foreign teenagers, my evidence will become more typical. There is one thing unknow, namely I cannot make sure whether the influence of social media to teenagers is unique and whether there is alternative product to replace social media. If there is no replacement, I can claim that social media is easily addicted as there is no replacement of it.</p>

        <p>​                                                   An introduction of window program</p>
<p>When I write codes, I always wonder that how others can use my code, especially for those who do not know much about Python. If they know little about Python, they even do not know how to run a single instruction. So I have to make my program more kind which means I have to improve the interactivity of my program. To achieve this purpose, I decide to introduce window program. In window program, there is button and displaying screen. By using this component, users can understand the purpose of the code better because tips can be written in the button or screen. For example, if I write a ‘plus 1’ on the button, users will know that if they click on the button, a number will plus 1.  Here is an example. First, I will show my original codes</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/d8baca2fbd3444ea.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/fc8f296435b91c4e.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/2bc3cd327d8f2e51.jpg"> </p>
<p>If you know little about Python, of course this is confusing. You will not know that to run this code you have to input ‘pickones()’ which is a fuction. But if I turn this code into window program.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/3d0feedde72f342e.png"> </p>
<p>It is more clear right? There is a button on the bottom of the left side called ‘pickone’, when users see this, they will know clicking the button can pick one. In another word, they know to run the code, they need to click the button. And the displaying screen is on the right of the button so that they can see the result. The background code of the window is shown below(use tkinter).</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This time, the task is about how to use regression to predict the price of second-hand car through some properties of the car. First of all, we should introduce some function to Python which has to been done every time. In addition, the dataset should be downloaded here. </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/3bb4f5f85bfa85ef.png"> </p>
<p>This dataset has 31 rows including SaleID, 15 known properties and 15 unknown properties. Unknown properties are expressed by V.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/bea4e0cc979c7545.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9e4387b8cda76031.png"> </p>
<p>  Then, in the regression, SaleID and name of the cars are useless properties which should be dropped or the accuracy of the result may be affected.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/2f9cd6386ed91a79.png"> </p>
<p>  There is another annoying point. The row of price is between the rows of known properties and the rows of unknown properties so we have to put price in the first row which is convenient for us to separate price and properties.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/540cfc8e67e7f000.png"> </p>
<p>  Next step is to separate test dataset and train dataset as well as price and properties. However, it is strange that unknown properties are all indicated by strings so we need to change the data type of unknown properties. The code with red line is what I did to solve this problem. </p>
<p>  <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/680a10c68fab539c.png"> </p>
<p> Finally, the most important step, use Linear Regression to train the data.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/713d7c3c59a05127.png"> </p>
<p> So far, all steps are done but we also need to test how well is the model trained. Here, I add the absolute difference of all trained value and all real value and then divide them by the total number. The final error is 2840 yuan. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p> After I learnt some basic knowledge about Arduino, I did a remote-controlled car with the help of some videos on the Internet and this is a record of how I made this car. The whole record will be broken into two parts. The first part aims to show how I put different pieces together and the second part will the codes used in this car.</p>
<p>  This is the part of putting pieces together. First I will show the final product.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/3e2f39194ca70208.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9296c887ceedb909.png"> </p>
<p>The whole car can be broken into three parts. Next, I will introduce them one by one.</p>
<p>——Mainboard</p>
<p>  Mainboard is the most difficult part to weld because there are so many small pieces in it. Before we weld it, it is empty.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/881812d638e3e8d7.png"> </p>
<p> After I weld it, it is filled with small components.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/f901913cf3281eb0.png"> </p>
<p> We can know what to weld by looking at the tips on the empty board. There are many patterns on the empty board and just find the component that follows the pattern. Do not forget that some components have positive and negative sides. And fix component well before you weld it or it will look ugly.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9b21f01a797d0946.png"> </p>
<p> After welding small pieces , we should put the mainboard and UNO board together and fix them to the bottom board of the car.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/d5661acc3c0e3502.png"> </p>
<p>——Sensor part</p>
<p>  Sensor part aims to achieve some functions of this car such as making the car move following a path and making the car avoid barriers automatically. First, following path is achieve by a infra-red</p>
<p>sensor. It can emit infra-red light and receive the reflected light to determine the color of the road.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/a3af0453a0cd1496.png"> </p>
<p> The next part is avoiding barriers. The principle of this part is similar to that of following path. It also used infers-red light to calculate the distance between barrier and it self to avoid barrier.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/44ae1a01124b1ed2.png"> </p>
<p>——battery and wheel part</p>
<p>  This is the most easy part to do because there is no special tips in this part. However, it is the most important part because it is the power of the whole car.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/71faa7a2b56b20ea.png"> </p>
<p> That is all for the three parts and finally we just need to connect wires between different parts.</p>

        <p>​    Recently, I read a new book called “Critical thinking and writing”. So far, I am interested in a topic called “Argument” in this book. When people write academic paper or articles, argument is hard to avoid so how to write a complete and good argument is really necessary. </p>
<p>​    First, what is argument should be indicated. Argument is made of three parts—precondition, reason and conclusion. Second, when does argument appear. My answer is ‘question’. If people have different opinions or confuse about a question, argument will exist because argument aims to express an ideal logically and clearly. To achieve this, a good reason is necessary because other people will depend on the reason to determine whether you are right. And for all reasons, it must be objective. “Objective” means that the reason is suitable for nearly all situations not just one person’s feeling.</p>

<p>​     This is the second Math book I read in my high school year and the previous book is The joy of X. Actually, the general content of these two books are similar so I would not discuss about the content of this book instead I would like to talk about some traits of this book.</p>
<p>​     A famous scientist used to say that ‘You had better learn calculus as it is the language</p>
<p>of god’ I believe this sentence and calculus is really necessary in our daily life. You may not </p>
<p>see it directly and actually it is applicated nearly everywhere. From our phones to the whole </p>
<p>internet system, all places need calculus. I highlight the importance of calculus here again. In </p>
<p>this book, the writer also wants to highlight the importance of calculus so he introduced the </p>
<p>electromagnetic waves first, which is discovered with the help of calculus and is very </p>
<p>necessary to electronic devices. Then, the writer goes deeper and deeper to show us that</p>
<p> calculus is very interesting and important. This book also tells the knowledge of calculus in </p>
<p>the form of stories which is suitable for students to read. </p>
<p>​      I enjoy the story of the area of circle most because I think this is the greatest story to </p>
<p>introduce calculus and nearly all books about calculus would talk about it. The first reason is </p>
<p>the area of circle is simple. The second reason is the area of circle perfectly explain the </p>
<p>center idea of calculus.</p>
<p>​      Overall, this book is good. I think this book is deeper in calculus than the joy of X. The </p>
<p>joy of X is like the introduction of calculus and infinite powers is the applications of </p>
<p>calculus.</p>

        <p>​                                                                     The revise of X Academy</p>
<p>   On the thirteenth of August, I successfully finished my activity in X Academy. In these 12 days, I learnt both computer skills and learning skills. This article aims to discuss what I learn and what I thought in these 12 days.</p>
<p>​    First, I would like to discuss the people I saw in X Academy. The people that impressed me most were my academic leaders. I first met them in the hotel. One of them study in MIT and one of them study in Stanford. I was deeply surprised by their universities. Before, I thought these universities are far away from me. But now, I know that there are many powerful people around me and I need to learn from them. Another thought I got in these 12 days was that I need to widen my horizons. I mean, I can not just concentrate my view in my school. Maybe, in my school, I was not bad. However, if I widen my horizons to the whole world, I could find that there are still a lot for me to do. The people I met in X Academy had all kinds of personalities and they have their own strong points. They are also my competitors so I also need to compare them with me to make me better. Also, I found that there are so many good students in this day so I should think about how to make me stand out of them.</p>
<p>​    Secondly, it is about my learning skills. During these 12 days, the most useful thing I learnt was how to study by myself. Before, if I meet problems, I would ask my teachers for help. This is good obviously. However, I should know that teacher would not appear every time so I had to learn how to study alone. Before, my only path to solve difficult problems was to ask my teacher for help. But now, I can use the Internet as my another useful partner. Generally speaking, I can not depend on others to study any more, I have to learn to find resources and solve problems by myself.</p>
