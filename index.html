        <p>Using Arduino to design a timer</p>
<p>Electronic engineering is a major that combines hardware and software. Hardware is the body of electronic engineering and software is the sprite of electronic engineering. I have not tried to combine them so far, so in this article, I will report a small timer designed by myself. The timer is made up of Arduino and it is coded by Arduino language. This report will be broken into three parts – design, hardware and software. </p>
<p>In the stage of design, we should get known what should be contained in this timer. There are two parts. First, there must be a screen to show the timer. Then, there must be components that can control the display of screen. The display of screen will be discussed in software part and the components needed will be contained in hardware part. I will introduce software part first.</p>
<p>Before coding, we need to think about what should be displayed in the screen. From my perspectives, there are 5 stages. One to tell you this is a timer.  <img src="http://test.imgurl.org/imgs/2022/04/10/4db2cd6c33c00e6c.jpg"> </p>
<p>​         One to ask you to set your time.    <img src="http://test.imgurl.org/imgs/2022/04/10/1945e02e93fbc294.jpg"> </p>
<p>​         One to provide a platform for you to set the time.    <img src="http://test.imgurl.org/imgs/2022/04/10/374e25cad4149922.jpg"> </p>
<p>​         One to display the time left.    <img src="http://test.imgurl.org/imgs/2022/04/10/950f681dfaa0064c.jpg"> </p>
<p>​         One to tell you time is over.   <img src="http://test.imgurl.org/imgs/2022/04/10/1c29e8af0fdab985.jpg"> </p>
<p>That is all we need to consider and following, I will show my code to realize this. Also, I want to mention that the code not only control the display of screen it also controll the process of hardware.</p>

<p>​         The last part is about hardware. The major job of hardware is to convert our thoughts into the instructions to screen. Of all hardware, there are only two output components – screen and a buzzer. Why I need a buzzer here because user can not check the screen all the time so we need a component to tell the user that time is over. Other are input devices. For example, we need a stick to control the cursor on the screen. You can consider that the stick is a form of mouse used. Also, we need a button that can be clicked because mouse can be clicked but stick cannot so we need an extra component to realize this. In general, I divide mouse into stick and button in this project as Arduino does not provide mouse, at least I do not have mouse for Arduino.  </p>

        <p>Using Python to design a game – 2</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the last post, this is a report about the game written by Python with pygame designed by myself. In this game, I want to choose a completely different game – a running game, namely there is a person running and we can control it to jump or lay or give skills to avoid colliding with obstacles. However, there are still many points that are similar to that in game-1 so in this report I just mention something different. First, in this game, I want my background to move to build an atmosphere of running. To achieve this, I put two screens. Each screen will move to left step by step. If one screen touches boundary line, it will go to the other side. Also, to build the atmosphere of running, I need an animated player. To solve this, I get several pictures for player and if I display them one by one, the player might seem running. Also, in the previous game, there is no skills or spells and, in this game, I will fulfill this gap. I do not want to explain this too carefully in this report and I will share my code. Make a conclusion about skills, one is to make the player unbeatable for a short while. The other one is to shoot a bullet and, if the bullet touches obstacles, obstacles will be removed. Here is my code:</p>

        <p>Day2</p>
<p>Followed by day1, next I am going to design a board that can realize the graph we draw in day1. However, this part will be broken into two days. First, to design a board, we need to draw another principal graph which is similar as that of day1 but it is special for the board. Then, on the second day, I am going to design the board into real-life size. The reason for me to divide it is because, in the second part, many properties are needed to be measured. Go back to today’s work, we need to convert electronic graph into principle graph in Kicad which is a professional software to design board. First, let me show the graph in day1 and we can compare the difference.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/10/006a53a00d8c8007.jpg"> </p>
<p>Next, it is the graph in Kicad.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/10/d8d0d7986b423c84.jpg"> </p>
<p>We can clearly find that the symbol of the same electronic device is different. For example, in the first picture, ammeter is a rectangle with screen but in the second picture, the ammeter is a circle with positive and negative pole. Among all components, I want to emphasis the part that I use a purple circle to mark. I think this is the largest difference. In a board, we cannot equip so many switches as we need to minimize the area of the board so we need a special switch that have five levels which I mean one switch that can control the state of five circuit. Unfortunately, in the library of Kicad, there is no switch with five levels. The largest one has three level so we need to define a switch by ourselves. I will not talk about this in detail today and I just show the final shape is just what I show to you. That is all for today and next day I will take you to measure different properties and design a board in real size.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Object-oriented or process-oriented</p>
<p>This is common question asked by program learner. Here, I will give my personal idea about it. Object-oriented means it emphasis on each individual. It looks what you can do. Process-oriented emphasis on the steps of task. For example, there is an exam. If you concern what does teacher do and what does candidate do, this is object-oriented. However, if you concern, what should be done first and what is next, this is process-oriented. Commonly, people are used to process-oriented thinking. </p>
<p>Then, I want to discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of these two concept. For process-oriented, I think the main advantage is that it is easier to be understood as it is similar to human’s thinking. But the disadvantage is that all things are linked together and it is hard to replace any element in it. however, for object-oriented, it is completely opposite. It is easily to change but hard to understand. If you check an object-oriented program, you will find that different functions and procedures are everywhere and it is hard to understand. The only method to reduce this is writing comments. As a result, if you just write a small amount of code, you can write in process-oriented as it is fast and is easily understood. However, if you write a huge program, you had best to write in object-oriented as there are many maintenances later. Using object-oriented is easier to be modified. But you can also write process-oriented to smooth your thoughts then go back to object-oriented. </p>
<p>Why I want to talk about this topic. Because, when I learnt how to use Python to write code, the teacher firstly wrote process-oriented code to make us understand and then change it into object-oriented code to fulfill it. at first, I did not understand why the teacher taught in this way util I did some research about it and this topic really activates my thoughts about how to write code in a more efficient way.</p>

        <p>Physics connects with Math</p>
<p>I find an interesting question from the internet. The question is there are two masses. The left one is at rest with a mass of 1kg and the right one has a mass of 100**n kg with a speed of 10 m/s. Also, there is a wall on the left of the left mass. The question is how many collisions are there including mass colliding mass and mass colliding wall. (All collisions are elastic)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIxr4"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIxr4.jpg" alt="qHIxr4.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I use Python to solve this question. First, we just need to define each object here. Then, we use conservation of momentum and conservation of energy to modify the collision. Also, the number of collisions will change as the mass of left mass changes(100**n kg). <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIzqJ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIzqJ.jpg" alt="qHIzqJ.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHo9aR"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHo9aR.jpg" alt="qHo9aR.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The result for different n is shown.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHoiPx"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHoiPx.jpg" alt="qHoiPx.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Do not you think that the result is very interesting. It seems that this question is not related with circle but pi appears here. After doing some research about this question, experts said that if you draw a diagraph for this question, you will find that circle appear. I would show the graph.</p>
<p>This is for n = 2</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHonZd"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHonZd.jpg" alt="qHonZd.jpg"></a></p>
<p>So do not look down any questions, the result might give you surprise.</p>

        <p>Using Python to design a game</p>
<p>A few days ago, I found a teaching video about how to design a game using python in bilibili. I haven’t tried to do this so I decide to take a look.</p>
<p>This game is called ‘Plane fighting’. As the name suggests, in this game, there are two planes. One is enemy and one is me. Enemy is controlled by computer and our plane is controlled by ourselves. Both planes will shoot bullets. If we are hit, we will lose. If enemy is hit, we will get a point and then it will appear again util we lose. Because this code is a bit long and complex, I would explain step by step, I just give a general explanation of what I did. Also, I want to mention the whole game is designed using a library in Python called Pygame.</p>
<p>Step1: We should define a screen using pygame and all instructions we did will base on the screen. It is quite easy to do it – getting a picture used as screen then follow the instruction of pygame to display it.</p>
<p>Step 2: We should define a class called player. Inside the class, we need to concern two problems. One is to display the player. Second is how to control it. To solve the first question, we need to get a picture to represent the player and display it using functions contained in pygame. The same principle is applied to how to control it. There is a function in pygame to detect the information got from the keyboard.</p>
<p>Step3: We need to define a class called player_bullet. Bullet is different from player as bullet does not to be controlled so it is much easier to de defined.</p>
<p>Step4: This step is quite similar as the previous two steps. We need to define the classes for enemy and enemy bullets. The difference is that enemy does not to be controlled and it should follows a path.</p>
<p>Step5: We should write a program to detect whether player or enemy touches bullets. </p>
<p>Here I will give my codes and the code is quite long so there are many pictures:</p>

<p>These are my codes. But I will not only show you my codes because that will be too boring. I will also show the result to you. As we start the program, there is a button. If you click it, the game will start.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIeNq"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIeNq.jpg" alt="qHIeNq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then, the screen is like this:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIuCV"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIuCV.jpg" alt="qHIuCV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We can see that there are bullets and player as well as enemy. Also, your score will be displayed at the center of the screen. If you lose, it will look like this.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIK3T"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIK3T.jpg" alt="qHIK3T.jpg"></a></p>
<p>You can start the game as you click again. Also, if your bullet hit the enemy, you will get scores. As I cannot post a video, I can only show pictures to you.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHI3DJ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHI3DJ.jpg" alt="qHI3DJ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>That is all for this game. It is a quite interesting learning process for me. My coding ability and my understanding about object-oriented coding and process-oriented coding have been improved a lot. In a few days later, I will design a new game as this game is design by others and I just learn how to write from others. Next game will be written by myself and I will say something about my understanding about object-oriented coding and process-oriented coding.</p>

<p>I am very sorry that I made a mistake in day one. This is the final graph of day-1.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/9e1b141773baeedb.png"> </p>
<p>First, I have to mention that there is no huge mistake but I miss a wire that should be connect in the graph. This is the correct graph.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/1b34fd7d0874cc77.jpg"> </p>
<p>As you can see, I add a purple line in it. Though it is just a wire, if it is missed, the whole part to measure current will not work because this wire connect the whole section to battery. </p>

        <p>Multimeter-day1</p>
<p>Today, it is the first day for I to design a multimeter by myself. </p>
<p>Today, I draw the electricity circuit which is used to measure voltage and current in a multimeter.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand how traditional current meter works.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/77d75ffe7f3b6ba7.jpg"> </p>
<p>Generally, the basic principle is that when there is current passing through the coil, the coil will experience a force in a magnetic field so that the needle will deflect. And when we design the circuit do not forget that the coil has its resistance.</p>
<p>In addition, in a normal multimeter, each part has different measurement range. For example, if you want to measure current, there is a level for current of maximum 5A or maximum 10A. Before we start measuring current, we have to choose the right level or it might be out of range or too small to be measured.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/62b2db5f68588dbd.png"> </p>
<p>This is the final circuit I draw for measuring current. It has different measuring range and do not forget the coil itself has resistance. In the diagraph, the current meter is coil and the source is the current that we want to measure.</p>
<p>The same principle is applied for measuring voltage. But there is one important thing, if we measure current, resistors must be connected in parallel to divide current. However, in measuring voltage, the have to connect resistors in series to divide voltage. </p>
<ul>
<li> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/647683ea89a23876.png"> The last thing for today is to combine this two circuit. I choose to use a special switch like this.</li>
<li> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/1a93c0372673c9d7.jpg"> </li>
<li> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/9e1b141773baeedb.png"> </li>
<li>This is the final circuit. When we want to alternate from measuring current to voltage, we just need to alternate the switch.</li>
</ul>

        <p>Java practice two</p>
<p>Question: A person wants to buy some milk tea with 500 dollar and he wants to spend all of the money. How to write a code to find the solution that the man can buy as much milk tea as possible and there is no repetitive taste.</p>
<p>For this question, the first and the most tuff work for me is to input all data about milk tea which costs me a lot of time. Also, we need to define a new data type that can store the name of milk tea and its price together. Then, we have to order it with descending the price to make it more convenient for us to write code. I would just show part of the code to input data and the code to order milk tea.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/abb47637d8d9d6cf.jpg"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/322e106b54a353c2.jpg"> </p>
<p>Then, we need to find the solution to select most milk tea. To buy as much milk tea as possible, we need to buy more cheaper milk tea. My idea is to add all milk tea from cheapest to most expensive one by one until it first exceeds or is equal to 500 dollar. If it is 500 dollar, that is wonderful because there will not be any better solution but the real situation is that it exceeds 500 dollar. Then, the most important step comes. We should remove the last milk tea added as it is extra. After removing it, we can find that there is a gap between 500 dollar and our list so we should replace the last milk tea in our current list and we need a milk tea with a price which is equal to the gap plus the price of the milk tea we removed. In this part, a simple loop search is used and then the question is solved. Here is my code:</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/bbd99d31a4f2765c.jpg"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/4791e906dce7b4ff.jpg"> </p>
<p>And the final answer is 27:</p>
