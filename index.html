        <p>The design of analog amperemeter and voltmeter</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><h3 id="Why-to-choose-this-project"><a href="#Why-to-choose-this-project" class="headerlink" title="Why to choose this project"></a>Why to choose this project</h3><p>I started learning Physics from Grade 7 and, in Physics, there is an important chapter called ‘Electricity’. Many quantities, such as current and voltage, are required to be measured in practical in this chapter. In my middle school, I usually used amperemeter (Figure 1) to measure current and voltmeter (Figure 2) was commonly used to measure potential difference. Both of them are called analog meters or conventional meters. However, in my high school, analog meters were replaced by multimeters (Figure 3), also called digital meters. Compared with conventional meters, multimeters can measure both current and potential difference and even resistance of a component can be measured. Also, common multimeters can have several gears for one quantity. For example, if you want to measure current, you can either choose a gear of maximum range of 10A or a gear of maximum range of 1A. In this project, I want to design and produce a conventional meter and a multimeter by myself to explore how these equipment works. Also, I would mix some personal ideas to these equipment to make them more powerful.<br>It is essential to mention that, for this project, I draw principle circuit using Multisim (A software to draw principle circuit) (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.multisim.com/">https://www.multisim.com/</a>) , draw schematic and PCB (Printed circuit board) using KiCad (A software to draw schematic and PCB) (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://componentsearchengine.com/library/kicad?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyOyf2p_r-AIV5JNmAh2FQwoOEAAYASAAEgLkNPD_BwE">https://componentsearchengine.com/library/kicad?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIyOyf2p_r-AIV5JNmAh2FQwoOEAAYASAAEgLkNPD_BwE</a>) , buy components from Jia Li Chuang (A company to sell electronic components)(<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.jlc.com/">https://www.jlc.com/</a>) .<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdYZj"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdYZj.png" alt="xYdYZj.png"></a> Figure1<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYd8sg"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYd8sg.png" alt="xYd8sg.png"></a>Figure2<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xY0n8P"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xY0n8P.png" alt="xY0n8P.png"></a>Figure3</p>
<h3 id="How-to-do-this-project"><a href="#How-to-do-this-project" class="headerlink" title="How to do this project"></a>How to do this project</h3><p>This project consists of two main stages. One is designing a conventional multimeter and the second stage is designing a digital multimeter. For each stage, I would mention background knowledge needed and analysis the principle of the equipment. Also, I would show the circuits, schematics and PCBs used in this project. Each multimeter might have several versions as there may be some problems in previous ones, so I would demonstrate all of them and show how I finish it step by step.<br>Design of conventional multimeter<br>Analysis of how conventional amperemeter and voltmeter work<br>First, let me show a conventional amperemeter (Figure 4) again.<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdtds"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdtds.png" alt="xYdtds.png"></a>Figure4<br>There is a needle which can deflect and, as the needle deflects, it can point to a value on the dial. If we remove the shell of the amperemeter, we can see that inside the amperemeter, there is an electrical and magnetic structure (Figure 5). Before I introduce how it works, I have to mention a theory, namely current will experience a force in a magnetic field (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py106/MagForce.html">http://physics.bu.edu/~duffy/py106/MagForce.html</a>). Moreover, I would briefly explain why it is true. It is proved that there is a magnetic field around a current (the prove of this theory is beyond my knowledge) so when current is in a magnetic field, the produced field will interact with the existing one like Figure 6 and current will experience a force. Then, let me go back to how the meters work. The basic principle of amperemeter and voltmeter is similar so I would introduce their similarities first and then I would discuss their difference. Whatever it is voltmeter or amperemeter, as soon as you connect it into a circuit, current will flow into the meter. Then, through am equation F=BIL (B is the magnetic flux density,I is current,L is the perpendicular length of current in the magnetic field), we can see that the force experience is directly proportional to the magnitude of current. Then, the force will produce a torque to the needle and push it to deflect. As a result, the degree of the deflection is also proportional to the magnitude of the current. That is the basic principle of how it works.<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdDQU"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdDQU.png" alt="xYdDQU.png"></a>Figure5<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYd0zT"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYd0zT.png" alt="xYd0zT.png"></a>Figure6<br>Second, let me discuss what is the difference between amperemeter and voltmeter. Commonly, we know that amperemeter must be connected in series into a circuit (Figure 7) while voltmeter must be connected in parallel (Figure 8). Why is this. If we do more research about these meters, we can see that amperemeter usually has small resistance and voltmeter usually has huge resistance because, inside the meters, apart from a component like Figure 5, there are also some resistors connected in series or parallel (For amperemeter it is parallel (Figure 9), for voltmeter it is series (Figure 10)). I would use my diagram to explain why the internal structure is like this. In conclusion, both of amperemeter and voltmeter use ‘current will experience a force in a magnetic field’ to measure electrical quantities, the only difference is their internal structure. Also, from this research, we can feel that usage depends on structure. If you want to know more detailed information about amperemeter and voltmeter, you can go to  (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/ammeter.html">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/ammeter.html</a>) to learn more about amperemeter and go to (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/voltmeter.html">https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/voltmeter.html</a>) to learn more about voltmeter.<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYddJ0"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYddJ0.png" alt="xYddJ0.png"></a>Figure7<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdwWV"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdwWV.png" alt="xYdwWV.png"></a>Figure8<br>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYd6eJ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYd6eJ.png" alt="xYd6eJ.png"></a>Figure9</p>

<h2 id="Circuit-for-conventional-multimeter"><a href="#Circuit-for-conventional-multimeter" class="headerlink" title="Circuit for conventional multimeter"></a>Circuit for conventional multimeter</h2><h3 id="A-general-introduction-of-what-I-want-to-do"><a href="#A-general-introduction-of-what-I-want-to-do" class="headerlink" title="A general introduction of what I want to do"></a>A general introduction of what I want to do</h3><p>As I mentioned in previous page, the basic electrical and magnetic structure for amperemeter and voltmeter is completely same so in this project, I want to combine voltmeter and amperemeter into a single equipment. Also, I want to set several gears for this multimeter so that users can choose most suitable gear to get a clearer reading (For example, the current you want to measure is 0.5A. If you use a gear of maximum range of 10A, it will only deflect about 4.5 degree. If you use a gear of maximum range of 1A, it will deflect 45 degree).   </p>
<h3 id="Design-for-amperemeter"><a href="#Design-for-amperemeter" class="headerlink" title="Design for amperemeter"></a>Design for amperemeter</h3><p>The electrical and magnetic component consists of coils, a needle and a magnet. The coil is connected to the circuit so coil is also a part of the circuit. As a result, the resistance of the circuit cannot be ignored. The first step is to measure the resistance of the coil. Through R=U/I, we can apply a potential difference to the coil and measure the current passing through it. Then, different potential difference can be applied to get a more accurate value. I did a measurement like this (Figure 11) with a coil that I would use in this project (Figure 12,13). I recorded the data and use data fitting in excel to calculate the resistance of the coil. Because of the unit of current I used was mA, so the final resistance was 1.4677KΩ which is 1468Ω.<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdsL4"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdsL4.png" alt="xYdsL4.png"></a>Figure11<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdgoR"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdgoR.png" alt="xYdgoR.png"></a>Figure12<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdWJx"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdWJx.png" alt="xYdWJx.png"></a>Figure13<br>If we just connect the coil to a normal circuit, there would be little deflection as the resistance is too large. As a result, we must connect resistors in parallel with the coil to reduce the overall resistance of the amperemeter so my circuit would look like this (Figure 14). You might ask a question why I connected so many resistors and switches. That is what I mentioned before. I want to set several gears for the multimeter. Through my experiment, I found that the maximum current that the coil can hold is 0.1mA, if the current experienced by the coil is greater that 0.1mA, then the needle point out of the dial. With this information, we can easily determine the magnitude of the resistor connected. For example, if I hope that I can measure a maximum of 5mA. This means that when I connect the amperemeter to a circuit with 1A, the current flowing through the coil is 0.1mA because the resistors connected parallel with the coil might share some current with it. As they are in parallel, their potential difference is the same so we use U=IR to get the potential difference in this situation is 0.147V. The coil only takes 0.1mA so the resistor will take 4.9mA. Using R=U/I, we can get that the resistance required is 30Ω. Following the same principle, we can calculate the resistance required by other gears. Last, it is important to take care that, as gears are different, we must make a dial by ourself to satisfy different gears.<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwBtI"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwBtI.png" alt="xYwBtI.png"></a>Figure14</p>
<h3 id="Design-for-voltmeter"><a href="#Design-for-voltmeter" class="headerlink" title="Design for voltmeter"></a>Design for voltmeter</h3><p>For voltmeter, the only difference is that resistors are connected in series with the coil because resistors in series can share the voltage with coil. From U=IR, we can calculate that the maximum voltage that can coil can hold is 0.147V. As a result, if we hope that the voltmeter can measure a maximum voltage of 10V, the resistor must take 9.853V which means its resistance is 98530Ω (almost 100KΩ). Following the same principle, we can calculate the resistance required by other gears. The final circuit would look like this (Figure 15). You might ask if we connect such a huge resistance with the coil, the overall resistance of the voltmeter would be extremely huge. Yes, it is. But it does not matter as voltmeter is connected in parallel with circuit. If the resistance of the voltmeter is very high, it would not affect the circuit too much.<br>    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdfW6"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdfW6.png" alt="xYdfW6.png"></a>Figure15</p>
<h2 id="First-version-of-combination-of-voltmeter-and-ampere"><a href="#First-version-of-combination-of-voltmeter-and-ampere" class="headerlink" title="First version of combination of voltmeter and ampere"></a>First version of combination of voltmeter and ampere</h2><h3 id="Principle-circuit-for-the-first-combination"><a href="#Principle-circuit-for-the-first-combination" class="headerlink" title="Principle circuit for the first combination"></a>Principle circuit for the first combination</h3><p>Why I say it is the first combination? Because I made a mistake in the design of the combined graph, I would analysis the mistake in the test part. And, in this paragraph, I would still use the wrong one because this is the process of learning. The correct graph is in the second version. The first draft is like Figure 16. The combination of voltmeter and ampere means only one coil is shared. If it is separated meters, each one can contain a coil. But, to connect them, they must share it. After realizing this, the problem now is how to deal with two groups of resistors. One would be connected in series with the coil (voltmeter) and the other group would be connected in parallel with it (ampere). To achieve this goal, I choose to use a SPDT switch (single pole double throw switch).<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYd4SK"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYd4SK.png" alt="xYd4SK.png"></a>Figure16</p>
<h3 id="Design-of-schematic"><a href="#Design-of-schematic" class="headerlink" title="Design of schematic"></a>Design of schematic</h3><p>There is only one change made to the schematic. From the circuit, we can see that I set 4 gears for amperemeter and 5 gears for voltmeter but it is impossible for me to equip so many switches and I hope that only two switches can be used. Finally, I choose to use a rotary switch called C508440 (Figure 17)(<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://atta.szlcsc.com/upload/public/pdf/source/20200407/C508442_06221D97AB66BB11D47530C9AEBA3201.pdf">https://atta.szlcsc.com/upload/public/pdf/source/20200407/C508442_06221D97AB66BB11D47530C9AEBA3201.pdf</a>). For this switch, you can just rotate it to change gears which is convenient. However, there is no symbol for this component in the schematic of KiCad so I need to draw it by myself (Figure 18). Also, I need to draw a symbol for the coil used (Figure 19). With these preparations, we can start drawing our schematic (Figure 20).</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdRF1"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdRF1.png" alt="xYdRF1.png"></a>Figure17<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdoOe"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdoOe.png" alt="xYdoOe.png"></a>Figure18<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYd5QO"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYd5QO.png" alt="xYd5QO.png"></a>Figure19<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYdIyD"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYdIyD.png" alt="xYdIyD.png"></a>Figure20</p>
<h3 id="Design-of-PCB"><a href="#Design-of-PCB" class="headerlink" title="Design of PCB"></a>Design of PCB</h3><p>After drawing schematic, there is function in KiCad called ‘Update PCB from schematic’, which can convert your schematic into PCB directly. However, we still need to set footprint for each component used in schematic so that it can be displayed in PCB. For components like resistors, we can use ready-made footprint in KiCad but we still need to draw footprint for components like rotary switch (Figure 21), coil (Figure 22), SPDT switch (Figure 24) and testing lines (a place to connect multimeter with circuit) (Figure 23). When we draw footprints for these components, we must follow the instructions in the introduction of the components you bought, especially making sure your pin number and poles are correct, or there would be something wrong with your PCB. When we finish drawing footprint, we can create our PCB (Figure 25). So far, our PCB just demonstrate some components and we need to organize them and set wires to connect them (Figure 26).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYd7eH"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYd7eH.png" alt="xYd7eH.png"></a>Figure21<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwlkR"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwlkR.png" alt="xYwlkR.png"></a>Figure22<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwM79"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwM79.png" alt="xYwM79.png"></a>Figure23<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwK0J"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwK0J.png" alt="xYwK0J.png"></a>Figure24<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYw1t1"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYw1t1.png" alt="xYw1t1.png"></a>Figure25<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwo90"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwo90.png" alt="xYwo90.png"></a>Figure26<br>When we finish designing the PCB and making sure that the graph has no errors, we can send the graph to PCB producers and wait for it (Figure 27).<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYw5hq"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYw5hq.png" alt="xYw5hq.png"></a>Figure27<br>The next step is to weld the components on the PCB (Figure 28). I try to place the coil into the PCB but it seems that the holes are too close to each other so I have to polish them.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYw4Nn"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYw4Nn.png" alt="xYw4Nn.png"></a>Figure28</p>
<h3 id="Testing"><a href="#Testing" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>This is the most important part. There are some errors for both measuring current and voltage. First, the deflection of current is much larger that my expectation and if I do not set current part into initial gear, there would be no deflection for voltage part. The second problem is strange. For the first problem it might be caused the error of the magnitude of resistors (The wires might have resistance. The coil has resistance of 1400Ω and resistors for measuring voltage have huge resistance so the resistance of wires has little effect to them. But the resistance of resistors for measuring current is low so the extra resistance might have a large percentage increase to the magnitude of them which result in a larger current flowing through the coil ). But for the second problem, only current part can affect voltage part and voltage part will not affect current part. To find out the source of the error, I must go back to my principle circuit (Figure 20).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwhAs"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwhAs.png" alt="xYwhAs.png"></a>Figure20<br>Finally, it is the problem of the switch. If you analysis the circuit, you can find that if switch is turned up, resistors in series (resistors of voltage part) are separated which is correct. However, if switch is turned down, resistors in parallel (resistors of current part) are still connected in the circuit so this might be the cause of the second problem. As we know, the resistors for measuring current have low resistance so if they are connected in parallel, most current will flow through them instead of flowing through coil. As a result, there is little deflection for voltage part if current part is not turned to initial gear.</p>
<h2 id="Second-version-of-combination-of-voltmeter-and-ampere"><a href="#Second-version-of-combination-of-voltmeter-and-ampere" class="headerlink" title="Second version of combination of voltmeter and ampere"></a>Second version of combination of voltmeter and ampere</h2><h3 id="Principle-circuit-for-the-second-combination"><a href="#Principle-circuit-for-the-second-combination" class="headerlink" title="Principle circuit for the second combination"></a>Principle circuit for the second combination</h3><p>Because only one coil is used in this multimeter so the main structure of this multimeter cannot be changed and the only component we can alternate is the switch. We should use a switch that can either connecting voltage part and separating current part or connecting current part and separating voltage part. To achieve this, I go back to electronic component market and find a new switch called double-pole switch (Figure 29) (file:///C:/Users/user/Downloads/C1122348_%E5%BC%80%E5%85%B3_2021-03-25%20(2).PDF).<br>   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwquF"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwquF.png" alt="xYwquF.png"></a>Figure29<br>For this kind of switch, you can find that there are two keys inside it and they will act completely the same which means either both of them turns up or both of them turn down. With it, we can draw a new principle circuit (Figure 30).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwLB4"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwLB4.png" alt="xYwLB4.png"></a>Figure30<br>For this circuit, if you turn the switch up, current part is connected and voltage part is separated, if you turn the switch down, voltage part is connected and current part is separated.</p>
<h3 id="Design-of-schematic-1"><a href="#Design-of-schematic-1" class="headerlink" title="Design of schematic"></a>Design of schematic</h3><p>With the corrected principle circuit, we could draw a new schematic (Figure 31).<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwHjU"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwHjU.png" alt="xYwHjU.png"></a>Figure31<br>Almost everything in this schematic is the same as the previous one, the only difference is the switch so we need to draw a new symbol for it (Figure 32).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYw7cT"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYw7cT.png" alt="xYw7cT.png"></a>Figure32<br>I made a mistake in drawing the symbol again and the problem would be seen in testing part.</p>
<h3 id="Design-of-PCB-1"><a href="#Design-of-PCB-1" class="headerlink" title="Design of PCB"></a>Design of PCB</h3><p>Before creating the PCB, we need to design a new footprint for the switch (Figure 33). With the schematic, then we can create our PCB (Figure 34).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwx41"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwx41.png" alt="xYwx41.png"></a>Figure33<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwvNR"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwvNR.png" alt="xYwvNR.png"></a>Figure34<br>Next, we need to organize them and set wires (Figure 35).<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwOHJ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwOHJ.png" alt="xYwOHJ.png"></a>Figure35<br>Then, we send the PCB graph to PCB producers and wait for the new one (Figure 36).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYwjE9"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYwjE9.png" alt="xYwjE9.png"></a>Figure36<br>Then, it is time to weld components into the PCB (Figure 37).<br>  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xY0p36"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xY0p36.png" alt="xY0p36.png"></a>Figure37</p>
<h3 id="Testing-1"><a href="#Testing-1" class="headerlink" title="Testing"></a>Testing</h3><p>We are surprised to find that for the new board, neither measuring current nor measuring voltage show deflection. This is strange and the only cause would be that there is some thing broken in the circuit. After analyzing, it is the problem of the symbol of the double-pole switch.<br>When we draw symbols, we need to set pins for the component so that the component can be connected into the circuit and the side with ‘input’ must be outside the component because it is where component can be connected. But if you check my symbol (Figure 32). You can find that the output side is inside the component so actually the switch is not connected into the circuit which result in no deflection. And correct symbol should be like Figure 38.</p>

It looks ugly but it does work, after connecting two wires, all function of the PCB works well.<br> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xY0S9x"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xY0S9x.png" alt="xY0S9x.png"></a>Figure39</p>

        <p>Using Python to simulate projection</p>
<p>Projection is a very classical problem in Physics and Mechanics. I did a lot of problems about projection but I had never seen a practical projection. To realize this idea, I can only simulate it using python as, in real situations, there are many disturbing factors, such as air resistance. Also, I can just print all properties that I need of a projection at any fraction. The algorithm is easy to program. I just need to define the initial height, initial velocity and the angle of this velocity to the horizontal. Then, I wrote a algorithm to break this velocity into horizontal and vertical velocities. Also, I need to convert ‘distance is equal to speed multiplying time’ into algorithm so that I can get the coordinate of the object compared with initial position at any fraction of this projection. Finally, I need to display the position of the object with fixed time interval. Here is the code as well as the display of the code.</p>

        <p>Using Arduino to design a timer</p>
<p>Electronic engineering is a major that combines hardware and software. Hardware is the body of electronic engineering and software is the sprite of electronic engineering. I have not tried to combine them so far, so in this article, I will report a small timer designed by myself. The timer is made up of Arduino and it is coded by Arduino language. This report will be broken into three parts – design, hardware and software. </p>
<p>In the stage of design, we should get known what should be contained in this timer. There are two parts. First, there must be a screen to show the timer. Then, there must be components that can control the display of screen. The display of screen will be discussed in software part and the components needed will be contained in hardware part. I will introduce software part first.</p>
<p>Before coding, we need to think about what should be displayed in the screen. From my perspectives, there are 5 stages. One to tell you this is a timer.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYNiRS"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYNiRS.jpg" alt="xYNiRS.jpg"></a> </p>
<p>​         One to ask you to set your time.    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYNErj"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYNErj.jpg" alt="xYNErj.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​         One to provide a platform for you to set the time.    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYNAMQ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYNAMQ.jpg" alt="xYNAMQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​         One to display the time left.    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYNMGT"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYNMGT.jpg" alt="xYNMGT.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​         One to tell you time is over.   <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYNKiV"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/10/xYNKiV.jpg" alt="xYNKiV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>That is all we need to consider and following, I will show my code to realize this. Also, I want to mention that the code not only control the display of screen it also controll the process of hardware.</p>

<p>​         The last part is about hardware. The major job of hardware is to convert our thoughts into the instructions to screen. Of all hardware, there are only two output components – screen and a buzzer. Why I need a buzzer here because user can not check the screen all the time so we need a component to tell the user that time is over. Other are input devices. For example, we need a stick to control the cursor on the screen. You can consider that the stick is a form of mouse used. Also, we need a button that can be clicked because mouse can be clicked but stick cannot so we need an extra component to realize this. In general, I divide mouse into stick and button in this project as Arduino does not provide mouse, at least I do not have mouse for Arduino.  </p>

        <p>Using Python to design a game – 2</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the last post, this is a report about the game written by Python with pygame designed by myself. In this game, I want to choose a completely different game – a running game, namely there is a person running and we can control it to jump or lay or give skills to avoid colliding with obstacles. However, there are still many points that are similar to that in game-1 so in this report I just mention something different. First, in this game, I want my background to move to build an atmosphere of running. To achieve this, I put two screens. Each screen will move to left step by step. If one screen touches boundary line, it will go to the other side. Also, to build the atmosphere of running, I need an animated player. To solve this, I get several pictures for player and if I display them one by one, the player might seem running. Also, in the previous game, there is no skills or spells and, in this game, I will fulfill this gap. I do not want to explain this too carefully in this report and I will share my code. Make a conclusion about skills, one is to make the player unbeatable for a short while. The other one is to shoot a bullet and, if the bullet touches obstacles, obstacles will be removed. Here is my code:</p>

        <p>Day2</p>
<p>Followed by day1, next I am going to design a board that can realize the graph we draw in day1. However, this part will be broken into two days. First, to design a board, we need to draw another principal graph which is similar as that of day1 but it is special for the board. Then, on the second day, I am going to design the board into real-life size. The reason for me to divide it is because, in the second part, many properties are needed to be measured. Go back to today’s work, we need to convert electronic graph into principle graph in Kicad which is a professional software to design board. First, let me show the graph in day1 and we can compare the difference.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/10/006a53a00d8c8007.jpg"> </p>
<p>Next, it is the graph in Kicad.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/10/d8d0d7986b423c84.jpg"> </p>
<p>We can clearly find that the symbol of the same electronic device is different. For example, in the first picture, ammeter is a rectangle with screen but in the second picture, the ammeter is a circle with positive and negative pole. Among all components, I want to emphasis the part that I use a purple circle to mark. I think this is the largest difference. In a board, we cannot equip so many switches as we need to minimize the area of the board so we need a special switch that have five levels which I mean one switch that can control the state of five circuit. Unfortunately, in the library of Kicad, there is no switch with five levels. The largest one has three level so we need to define a switch by ourselves. I will not talk about this in detail today and I just show the final shape is just what I show to you. That is all for today and next day I will take you to measure different properties and design a board in real size.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>Object-oriented or process-oriented</p>
<p>This is common question asked by program learner. Here, I will give my personal idea about it. Object-oriented means it emphasis on each individual. It looks what you can do. Process-oriented emphasis on the steps of task. For example, there is an exam. If you concern what does teacher do and what does candidate do, this is object-oriented. However, if you concern, what should be done first and what is next, this is process-oriented. Commonly, people are used to process-oriented thinking. </p>
<p>Then, I want to discuss about the advantages and disadvantages of these two concept. For process-oriented, I think the main advantage is that it is easier to be understood as it is similar to human’s thinking. But the disadvantage is that all things are linked together and it is hard to replace any element in it. however, for object-oriented, it is completely opposite. It is easily to change but hard to understand. If you check an object-oriented program, you will find that different functions and procedures are everywhere and it is hard to understand. The only method to reduce this is writing comments. As a result, if you just write a small amount of code, you can write in process-oriented as it is fast and is easily understood. However, if you write a huge program, you had best to write in object-oriented as there are many maintenances later. Using object-oriented is easier to be modified. But you can also write process-oriented to smooth your thoughts then go back to object-oriented. </p>
<p>Why I want to talk about this topic. Because, when I learnt how to use Python to write code, the teacher firstly wrote process-oriented code to make us understand and then change it into object-oriented code to fulfill it. at first, I did not understand why the teacher taught in this way util I did some research about it and this topic really activates my thoughts about how to write code in a more efficient way.</p>

        <p>Physics connects with Math</p>
<p>I find an interesting question from the internet. The question is there are two masses. The left one is at rest with a mass of 1kg and the right one has a mass of 100**n kg with a speed of 10 m/s. Also, there is a wall on the left of the left mass. The question is how many collisions are there including mass colliding mass and mass colliding wall. (All collisions are elastic)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIxr4"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIxr4.jpg" alt="qHIxr4.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I use Python to solve this question. First, we just need to define each object here. Then, we use conservation of momentum and conservation of energy to modify the collision. Also, the number of collisions will change as the mass of left mass changes(100**n kg). <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIzqJ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIzqJ.jpg" alt="qHIzqJ.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The result for different n is shown.</p>

<p>Do not you think that the result is very interesting. It seems that this question is not related with circle but pi appears here. After doing some research about this question, experts said that if you draw a diagraph for this question, you will find that circle appear. I would show the graph.</p>
<p>This is for n = 2</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHonZd"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHonZd.jpg" alt="qHonZd.jpg"></a></p>
<p>So do not look down any questions, the result might give you surprise.</p>

        <p>Using Python to design a game</p>
<p>A few days ago, I found a teaching video about how to design a game using python in bilibili. I haven’t tried to do this so I decide to take a look.</p>
<p>This game is called ‘Plane fighting’. As the name suggests, in this game, there are two planes. One is enemy and one is me. Enemy is controlled by computer and our plane is controlled by ourselves. Both planes will shoot bullets. If we are hit, we will lose. If enemy is hit, we will get a point and then it will appear again util we lose. Because this code is a bit long and complex, I would explain step by step, I just give a general explanation of what I did. Also, I want to mention the whole game is designed using a library in Python called Pygame.</p>
<p>Step1: We should define a screen using pygame and all instructions we did will base on the screen. It is quite easy to do it – getting a picture used as screen then follow the instruction of pygame to display it.</p>
<p>Step 2: We should define a class called player. Inside the class, we need to concern two problems. One is to display the player. Second is how to control it. To solve the first question, we need to get a picture to represent the player and display it using functions contained in pygame. The same principle is applied to how to control it. There is a function in pygame to detect the information got from the keyboard.</p>
<p>Step3: We need to define a class called player_bullet. Bullet is different from player as bullet does not to be controlled so it is much easier to de defined.</p>
<p>Step4: This step is quite similar as the previous two steps. We need to define the classes for enemy and enemy bullets. The difference is that enemy does not to be controlled and it should follows a path.</p>
<p>Step5: We should write a program to detect whether player or enemy touches bullets. </p>
<p>Here I will give my codes and the code is quite long so there are many pictures:</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xYGav9"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/09/xYGav9.jpg" alt="xYGav9.jpg"></a></p>

But I will not only show you my codes because that will be too boring. I will also show the result to you. As we start the program, there is a button. If you click it, the game will start.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIeNq"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIeNq.jpg" alt="qHIeNq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then, the screen is like this:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIuCV"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIuCV.jpg" alt="qHIuCV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>We can see that there are bullets and player as well as enemy. Also, your score will be displayed at the center of the screen. If you lose, it will look like this.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHIK3T"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHIK3T.jpg" alt="qHIK3T.jpg"></a></p>
<p>You can start the game as you click again. Also, if your bullet hit the enemy, you will get scores. As I cannot post a video, I can only show pictures to you.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/qHI3DJ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/04/04/qHI3DJ.jpg" alt="qHI3DJ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>That is all for this game. It is a quite interesting learning process for me. My coding ability and my understanding about object-oriented coding and process-oriented coding have been improved a lot. In a few days later, I will design a new game as this game is design by others and I just learn how to write from others. Next game will be written by myself and I will say something about my understanding about object-oriented coding and process-oriented coding.</p>

<p>As you can see, I add a purple line in it. Though it is just a wire, if it is missed, the whole part to measure current will not work because this wire connect the whole section to battery. </p>

        <p>Multimeter-day1</p>
<p>Today, it is the first day for I to design a multimeter by myself. </p>
<p>Today, I draw the electricity circuit which is used to measure voltage and current in a multimeter.</p>
<p>First, I need to understand how traditional current meter works.</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xY85hF"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/09/xY85hF.jpg" alt="xY85hF.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Generally, the basic principle is that when there is current passing through the coil, the coil will experience a force in a magnetic field so that the needle will deflect. And when we design the circuit do not forget that the coil has its resistance.</p>
<p>In addition, in a normal multimeter, each part has different measurement range. For example, if you want to measure current, there is a level for current of maximum 5A or maximum 10A. Before we start measuring current, we have to choose the right level or it might be out of range or too small to be measured.</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgse.com/i/xY8T1J"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2022/10/09/xY8T1J.png" alt="xY8T1J.png"></a> </p>
<p>This is the final circuit I draw for measuring current. It has different measuring range and do not forget the coil itself has resistance. In the diagraph, the current meter is coil and the source is the current that we want to measure.</p>
<p>The same principle is applied for measuring voltage. But there is one important thing, if we measure current, resistors must be connected in parallel to divide current. However, in measuring voltage, the have to connect resistors in series to divide voltage. </p>
<ul>
<li> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/647683ea89a23876.png"> The last thing for today is to combine this two circuit. I choose to use a special switch like this.</li>
<li> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2022/04/04/1a93c0372673c9d7.jpg"> </li>

<li>This is the final circuit. When we want to alternate from measuring current to voltage, we just need to alternate the switch.</li>
</ul>
