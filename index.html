        <p>​                                                   An introduction of window program</p>
<p>When I write codes, I always wonder that how others can use my code, especially for those who do not know much about Python. If they know little about Python, they even do not know how to run a single instruction. So I have to make my program more kind which means I have to improve the interactivity of my program. To achieve this purpose, I decide to introduce window program. In window program, there is button and displaying screen. By using this component, users can understand the purpose of the code better because tips can be written in the button or screen. For example, if I write a ‘plus 1’ on the button, users will know that if they click on the button, a number will plus 1.  Here is an example. First, I will show my original codes</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/d8baca2fbd3444ea.png"> </p>

<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/2bc3cd327d8f2e51.jpg"> </p>
<p>If you know little about Python, of course this is confusing. You will not know that to run this code you have to input ‘pickones()’ which is a fuction. But if I turn this code into window program.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/12/3d0feedde72f342e.png"> </p>
<p>It is more clear right? There is a button on the bottom of the left side called ‘pickone’, when users see this, they will know clicking the button can pick one. In another word, they know to run the code, they need to click the button. And the displaying screen is on the right of the button so that they can see the result. The background code of the window is shown below(use tkinter).</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p>This time, the task is about how to use regression to predict the price of second-hand car through some properties of the car. First of all, we should introduce some function to Python which has to been done every time. In addition, the dataset should be downloaded here. </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/3bb4f5f85bfa85ef.png"> </p>
<p>This dataset has 31 rows including SaleID, 15 known properties and 15 unknown properties. Unknown properties are expressed by V.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/bea4e0cc979c7545.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9e4387b8cda76031.png"> </p>
<p>  Then, in the regression, SaleID and name of the cars are useless properties which should be dropped or the accuracy of the result may be affected.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/2f9cd6386ed91a79.png"> </p>
<p>  There is another annoying point. The row of price is between the rows of known properties and the rows of unknown properties so we have to put price in the first row which is convenient for us to separate price and properties.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/540cfc8e67e7f000.png"> </p>
<p>  Next step is to separate test dataset and train dataset as well as price and properties. However, it is strange that unknown properties are all indicated by strings so we need to change the data type of unknown properties. The code with red line is what I did to solve this problem. </p>
<p>  <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/680a10c68fab539c.png"> </p>
<p> Finally, the most important step, use Linear Regression to train the data.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/713d7c3c59a05127.png"> </p>
<p> So far, all steps are done but we also need to test how well is the model trained. Here, I add the absolute difference of all trained value and all real value and then divide them by the total number. The final error is 2840 yuan. </p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <p> After I learnt some basic knowledge about Arduino, I did a remote-controlled car with the help of some videos on the Internet and this is a record of how I made this car. The whole record will be broken into two parts. The first part aims to show how I put different pieces together and the second part will the codes used in this car.</p>
<p>  This is the part of putting pieces together. First I will show the final product.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/3e2f39194ca70208.png"> </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9296c887ceedb909.png"> </p>
<p>The whole car can be broken into three parts. Next, I will introduce them one by one.</p>
<p>——Mainboard</p>
<p>  Mainboard is the most difficult part to weld because there are so many small pieces in it. Before we weld it, it is empty.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/881812d638e3e8d7.png"> </p>
<p> After I weld it, it is filled with small components.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/f901913cf3281eb0.png"> </p>
<p> We can know what to weld by looking at the tips on the empty board. There are many patterns on the empty board and just find the component that follows the pattern. Do not forget that some components have positive and negative sides. And fix component well before you weld it or it will look ugly.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/9b21f01a797d0946.png"> </p>
<p> After welding small pieces , we should put the mainboard and UNO board together and fix them to the bottom board of the car.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/d5661acc3c0e3502.png"> </p>
<p>——Sensor part</p>
<p>  Sensor part aims to achieve some functions of this car such as making the car move following a path and making the car avoid barriers automatically. First, following path is achieve by a infra-red</p>
<p>sensor. It can emit infra-red light and receive the reflected light to determine the color of the road.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/a3af0453a0cd1496.png"> </p>
<p> The next part is avoiding barriers. The principle of this part is similar to that of following path. It also used infers-red light to calculate the distance between barrier and it self to avoid barrier.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/44ae1a01124b1ed2.png"> </p>
<p>——battery and wheel part</p>
<p>  This is the most easy part to do because there is no special tips in this part. However, it is the most important part because it is the power of the whole car.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/10/71faa7a2b56b20ea.png"> </p>
<p> That is all for the three parts and finally we just need to connect wires between different parts.</p>

        <p>​    Recently, I read a new book called “Critical thinking and writing”. So far, I am interested in a topic called “Argument” in this book. When people write academic paper or articles, argument is hard to avoid so how to write a complete and good argument is really necessary. </p>
<p>​    First, what is argument should be indicated. Argument is made of three parts—precondition, reason and conclusion. Second, when does argument appear. My answer is ‘question’. If people have different opinions or confuse about a question, argument will exist because argument aims to express an ideal logically and clearly. To achieve this, a good reason is necessary because other people will depend on the reason to determine whether you are right. And for all reasons, it must be objective. “Objective” means that the reason is suitable for nearly all situations not just one person’s feeling.</p>

<p>​     This is the second Math book I read in my high school year and the previous book is The joy of X. Actually, the general content of these two books are similar so I would not discuss about the content of this book instead I would like to talk about some traits of this book.</p>
<p>​     A famous scientist used to say that ‘You had better learn calculus as it is the language</p>
<p>of god’ I believe this sentence and calculus is really necessary in our daily life. You may not </p>
<p>see it directly and actually it is applicated nearly everywhere. From our phones to the whole </p>
<p>internet system, all places need calculus. I highlight the importance of calculus here again. In </p>
<p>this book, the writer also wants to highlight the importance of calculus so he introduced the </p>
<p>electromagnetic waves first, which is discovered with the help of calculus and is very </p>
<p>necessary to electronic devices. Then, the writer goes deeper and deeper to show us that</p>
<p> calculus is very interesting and important. This book also tells the knowledge of calculus in </p>
<p>the form of stories which is suitable for students to read. </p>
<p>​      I enjoy the story of the area of circle most because I think this is the greatest story to </p>
<p>introduce calculus and nearly all books about calculus would talk about it. The first reason is </p>
<p>the area of circle is simple. The second reason is the area of circle perfectly explain the </p>
<p>center idea of calculus.</p>
<p>​      Overall, this book is good. I think this book is deeper in calculus than the joy of X. The </p>
<p>joy of X is like the introduction of calculus and infinite powers is the applications of </p>
<p>calculus.</p>

<p>   On the thirteenth of August, I successfully finished my activity in X Academy. In these 12 days, I learnt both computer skills and learning skills. This article aims to discuss what I learn and what I thought in these 12 days.</p>
<p>​    First, I would like to discuss the people I saw in X Academy. The people that impressed me most were my academic leaders. I first met them in the hotel. One of them study in MIT and one of them study in Stanford. I was deeply surprised by their universities. Before, I thought these universities are far away from me. But now, I know that there are many powerful people around me and I need to learn from them. Another thought I got in these 12 days was that I need to widen my horizons. I mean, I can not just concentrate my view in my school. Maybe, in my school, I was not bad. However, if I widen my horizons to the whole world, I could find that there are still a lot for me to do. The people I met in X Academy had all kinds of personalities and they have their own strong points. They are also my competitors so I also need to compare them with me to make me better. Also, I found that there are so many good students in this day so I should think about how to make me stand out of them.</p>
<p>​    Secondly, it is about my learning skills. During these 12 days, the most useful thing I learnt was how to study by myself. Before, if I meet problems, I would ask my teachers for help. This is good obviously. However, I should know that teacher would not appear every time so I had to learn how to study alone. Before, my only path to solve difficult problems was to ask my teacher for help. But now, I can use the Internet as my another useful partner. Generally speaking, I can not depend on others to study any more, I have to learn to find resources and solve problems by myself.</p>

<p>​    Before I went to X Academy, I had to do some preparation for this activity to make sure that I could understand what teachers would say. My program in X Academy was called Data Science and I divided my preparation work into three parts – basic Math abilities, basic machine learning knowledge and basic applications of Python.</p>
<p>​    First, I would discuss Math anilities. Among Math abilities, I also divided it into three parts—functions, linear algebra and statistic. The reason why I needed to learn all kinds of functions was because, in data analysis, we may need to use function to calculate some values such as entropy. Additionally, functions are helpful when we learnt some principles of a model. Then, it was about linear algebra which was the most difficult part in Math abilities. However, it was also essential as Many models are based on linear algebra. Statistic was the most important part because we must use statistic models when we analyzed data such as using normal distribution.</p>
<p>​    Secondly, it was about machine learning. I did not need to know it in detail because I would learn it in my program. In the stage of preparation, I just need to learn what each model is like.</p>
<p>​    Last, I would talk about Python. This is the most essential part among my preparation as I would use Python to analyze data in my program. If I know little about it, it would be hard for me to write or read codes, which may make me fall behind the class.</p>

        <p>​                                                    My capstone of X Academy</p>
<p>​    In X Academy, everyone should do a project using what they learned here. In this article, I will discuss what I did in my capstone.</p>
<p>​    My program in X Academy was called Data Science so my capstone was related to processing data. I found my data set in a huge data set website called Kaggle. This data set was about the potability of water. It gave me a few properties of a kind of water such as ph, hardness, solids and I needed to use these properties to find whether this kind of water was potable.</p>
<p>​    First, I would show the first five rows of my data set.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/8f6c1cb22acc0a8e.jpg"> </p>
<p>​              By looking at the data, we could find that some data was lost in this data set so we needed to fill these lost data. The picture showed how many lost data are there in this data set.  </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/ad611dc7bd7b98bf.jpg"> </p>
<p>​    For this purpose, I chose to use the mean of the whole column to fill it as the mean of the whole column could make fewer errors. I took ph as example to show my codes.</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/0a3c68cc954731a5.jpg"> </p>
<p>​             After dealing with lost data of ph, sulfate and trihalomethanes, all lost data was filled again.  </p>
<p>  <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/cafa4947ad1610b7.jpg">  </p>
<p>​             Besides lost data, we could also find that some data in this data set was very unreasonable. For example, the ph of a kind of water was 2 but the data set still said that this water was potable. To get an accurate result, we needed to drop these data. Take ph as example, we should know the right save range for ph first, which was 6 to 9. Then, we checked the ph values of all kinds of water one by one. If the ph of this kind of water was lower than 6 or higher than 9 and the data set still said it was potable, we would drop the whole row of this water as this row of data was unreasonable.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hb8C01"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hb8C01.jpg" alt="hb8C01.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​     After doing this, the whole data was cleaned completely. The next step was to choose a model to analyze my data. I would like to tell an interesting story in this step. At first, I did not realize that this was a classification question so I chose a lot of regression models which was a waste of time. However, maybe regression was not completely useless. If I rounded the value predicted by the regression model, I may get a result which was similar to that got from classification models. In fact, I tried many classification models but there was a problem. Many models predicted that all water was not potable in this data set. I checked my codes for many times and I was sure that my codes were correct so I thought this was the problem of the data set which means the values in this data set were not very correct. Finally, I decided to use decision tree as my classification as it can both output 1 and 2. The picture below was my code.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hb8lAP"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hb8lAP.jpg" alt="hb8lAP.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​    So far, I had finished most of my code. The last step was to check the results predicted by my model. First, we can see that the accuracy of this model was only 77 precent which means the result of this model was not so good.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hb8M7t"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hb8M7t.jpg" alt="hb8M7t.jpg"></a></p>
<p>​    The picture above showed the specific result predicted by the model. We can find that, for potable water, the accuracy of my model was 50 precent. However, for unpotable water, the accuracy was 85 percent. So for this code, it had better be used to predict whether the water was unpotable instead of using it to predict whether the water was potable. In another words, if the model says the water is unpotable, you can trust it. However, if the model says the water is potable, you had better do not drink it.</p>

        <p>​                                                The report of Banqiao project (meeting 1)</p>
<p>​    On July 2, we went to Banqiao factory again. This time, we were able to take a look of a sample machine which was used to remove burrs on some particular components. Before this step was done by workers. However, the working environment of this job was very hard as this job was boring and workers would work in smoke. As a result, it was hard to employ workers and the cost of employing workers was high. To solve this problem, people wanted to use machine to replace most workers and just employed a few people to control it. In this article, I wanted to introduce the sample machine. Actually, the machine that I talked about this time was not the final product. It was just a sample to show how this kind of machine worked.</p>
<p>​    First, I wanted to show a general appearance of the sample machine.(figure1.1 1.2)</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/3c6ff6b47b3c3c96.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 1.1</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/3806f5ae229e73a3.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 1.2</p>
<p>​    Then, I would talk about it part by part. The first part was a holder to place components before machine worked. (figure 2.1) </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/35c213af8e02e7aa.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 2.1</p>
<p>​    In this holder, there were several supports to hold cylinder components. If the component had a different shape, we just needed to change the shape of supports and change the code of the machine. Under each support, there was a weight sensor which was used to check whether the component was placed well. Workers were needed to place components to the holder so workers could not be replaced completely. But this did not matter, the job was much better than the job which was needed to remove burrs.</p>
<p>​    The machine arm was also very important as cutters were fixed in this machine. It was the machine arm that controlled the components and put them towards the cutters. Moreover, burrs almost appeared on the same places of each component because burrs was caused by a few particular reasons which were same for all components. As a result, the machine arm just needed to repeat several steps. Also, you could find that the front part of the machine arm was much thinner as the part moved many times so it should be flexible. The latter part of the machine arm was much thicker as this part should be stable so that the whole machine would not shake easily. (figure 3.1)</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/b724c262c83ec72e.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 3.1</p>
<p>​    The last part was very simple – cutters and sand paper. Cutters were used to remove bigger burrs and sand paper was used to remove smaller burrs to make the component flatter. However, these two parts got broken easily so they were needed to be replaces regularly. (figure 4.1 – cutters) (figure 4.2 – sand paper) </p>

        <p>​                                                          Coding activity of 7.10<br>​    The subject of the coding activity on July 10 was linear regression. First, I would explain what was linear regression. For example, we had a set of data and we plotted it on a diagram just like figure 1.1.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbFLiq"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbFLiq.jpg" alt="hbFLiq.jpg"></a><br>Figure 1.1<br>​    And we wanted to predict the profit of the city which had a population of 23. We did not have the data directly but we could make sure that these data would follow a particular rule generally. If we could find the rule, we could predict the profit of a city with a population of 23. To achieve this, we used linear regression to draw a function just like figure 1.2 to represent the rule.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbk66U"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbk66U.jpg" alt="hbk66U.jpg"></a><br>figure 1.2<br>​    This was linear regression. When we have had a set of data in advance, we could use linear regression to calculate a function to represent the rule of this set of data.<br>​    Then, I wanted to introduce a new concept called Cost Function or Loss Function. Just like figure 1.1 and figure 1.2, we could find that the function that we calculated by linear regression could only represent the set of data generally. It was impossible to have function that could represent this kind of data perfectly. However, the function was useful, after all it could show a general rule and we could accept that there was some error. And Cost Function was used to show how much the error was. We calculated Cost Function in this way just like figure 2.1.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbkW79"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbkW79.jpg" alt="hbkW79.jpg"></a><br>Figure 2.1<br>​    After talking about linear regression and Cost function, I did a question. figure 3.1<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbACjS"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbACjS.jpg" alt="hbACjS.jpg"></a><br>figure 3.1<br>​    First, we needed to plot the data on a diagram. Figure 4.1. After plotting it, we could find that the data was a bit different from the example data that talked before. It was not linear. However, it did not matter. We still had method to deal with it. I would show two methods. One was done by me. The other was done by my classmate. These two methods were a bit different.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAn3V"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAn3V.jpg" alt="hbAn3V.jpg"></a><br>figure 4.1<br>​    First, I would show my method. Figure5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4<br>​    In figure 5.1, I defined some basic settings and introduced the data into the code.<br>​    In figure 5.2, I plotted the data.<br>​    In figure 5.3, I used linear regression to calculate the function.<br>​    In figure 5.4, I plotted the function.<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAt9x"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAt9x.png" alt="hbAt9x.png"></a><br>figure 5.1<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbArEd"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbArEd.png" alt="hbArEd.png"></a><br>figure 5.2<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAy4I"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAy4I.png" alt="hbAy4I.png"></a><br>figure 5.3<br>​    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgtu.com/i/hbAIEj"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/09/08/hbAIEj.png" alt="hbAIEj.png"></a><br>figure 5.4<br>​    Then, I would show the method of my classmate.
