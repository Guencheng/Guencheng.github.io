        <p>​                                                The report of Banqiao project (meeting 1)</p>
<p>​    On July 2, we went to Banqiao factory again. This time, we were able to take a look of a sample machine which was used to remove burrs on some particular components. Before this step was done by workers. However, the working environment of this job was very hard as this job was boring and workers would work in smoke. As a result, it was hard to employ workers and the cost of employing workers was high. To solve this problem, people wanted to use machine to replace most workers and just employed a few people to control it. In this article, I wanted to introduce the sample machine. Actually, the machine that I talked about this time was not the final product. It was just a sample to show how this kind of machine worked.</p>
<p>​    First, I wanted to show a general appearance of the sample machine.(figure1.1 1.2)</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/3c6ff6b47b3c3c96.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 1.1</p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/3806f5ae229e73a3.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 1.2</p>
<p>​    Then, I would talk about it part by part. The first part was a holder to place components before machine worked. (figure 2.1) </p>
<p> <img src="https://s3.bmp.ovh/imgs/2021/09/35c213af8e02e7aa.jpg"> </p>
<p>figure 2.1</p>
<p>​    In this holder, there were several supports to hold cylinder components. If the component had a different shape, we just needed to change the shape of supports and change the code of the machine. Under each support, there was a weight sensor which was used to check whether the component was placed well. Workers were needed to place components to the holder so workers could not be replaced completely. But this did not matter, the job was much better than the job which was needed to remove burrs.</p>
<p>​    The machine arm was also very important as cutters were fixed in this machine. It was the machine arm that controlled the components and put them towards the cutters. Moreover, burrs almost appeared on the same places of each component because burrs was caused by a few particular reasons which were same for all components. As a result, the machine arm just needed to repeat several steps. Also, you could find that the front part of the machine arm was much thinner as the part moved many times so it should be flexible. The latter part of the machine arm was much thicker as this part should be stable so that the whole machine would not shake easily. (figure 3.1)</p>

<p>figure 3.1</p>
<p>​    The last part was very simple – cutters and sand paper. Cutters were used to remove bigger burrs and sand paper was used to remove smaller burrs to make the component flatter. However, these two parts got broken easily so they were needed to be replaces regularly. (figure 4.1 – cutters) (figure 4.2 – sand paper) </p>
