        <p>​                            My thoughts about three different Maths competitions</p>
<p>So far, in my grade 10, I have attended three distinct Maths competitions which are UKMT, AMC and Euclid Maths Competition respectively. In this article, I will talk about my own experiences of these competitions as well as my thoughts about each competition and I will discuss the differences among these competitions.</p>
<p>First, I want to talk about UKMT. Personally, I think UKMT is the easiest competition among them because the amount of knowledge that UKMT will test is very limited and UKMT won’t give questions in a very deep level except the last few questions. Also, the requirement of UKMT for people to get a reward is very low. I remember that, if people can answer the first 20 questions correctly, they can get the gold reward even without answering the last few questions which are relatively more difficult correctly. It were  my school teachers who let me attend UKMT. At that time, I was relatively free so I agreed at once and, later, I just did a few past papers to get the idea of the style of UKMT papers. Last, I got the gold reward. To be honest, if people really pay attention to this competition, it is really easy for people to get a reward. Though UKMT is not so valuable, I think it is still worth attending because UKMT is a formal international competition. Attending UKMT can make people build an idea of how to do and how to prepare for a competition, which is a very important skill in further study. In the future, there will be many distinct competitions. If people have had similar experience before such as attending UKMT, people will be less nervous and they will know what they should do to prepare for competitions to get a better performance. That is why I say attending UKMT is useful. </p>
<p>Then, I want to talk about AMC. Personally, I reckon that AMC is the most difficult competition among these three competitions. This is for three reasons. One reason is that AMC tests a lot of knowledge points. I even have not learnt some of them so this will make AMC harder than other two competitions because people can hardly work out new knowledge points without the explanation of teachers. Also, the questions given by AMC are a bit difficult. AMC won’t test knowledge points directly. People have to find what the question really wants to test before people can work out the question or people will not know how to start solving it. The third difficulty is that the time given by AMC for people to solve problems is very limited. Unlike UKMT, which gives people 2 hours to solve problems, AMC only provides 1 hour and 15 minutes with more difficult questions. As a result, when I did AMC, I had to make choices because I could not work out all questions in such a limited time. For these three reasons, AMC is relatively more difficult. In fact, I did not do very well in AMC because AMC was in winter holiday when I played so much that I did not prepare for AMC well. Moreover, for competitions like AMC, a ready preparation is really important. People had better go over what AMC might test in advance or if people meet some new knowledge points in AMC, they can do nothing but give it up. However, generally speaking, AMC is a really valuable competition. AMC can widen our horizons in the area of Maths if people analyze the questions in AMC carefully because they can learn know new knowledge (in the period of preparation). Also, AMC can develop people’s ability in solving difficult problems which is really useful. For example, when doing AMC, people should do what they can do first leaving difficult problems and, if they have extra time, they can go back to solve difficult ones as people have to make sure that they can get as many points as possible. Just as I say, not all competitions are as easy as UKMT so this kind of skill is useful in future study.</p>
<p>Then, I will talk about Euclid Maths Competition. In fact, its degree of difficulty is just between AMC and UKMT. The knowledge that Euclid Maths Competition tests is all what we have learnt. However, its last three problems are a bit difficult. Also, Euclid Maths Competition will provide 2.5 hours for people, though people mat not solve all questions in such a long time because I have to admit that the last three questions are very difficult. Nevertheless, such amount of time is definitely enough for people to do the first seven questions, which means, if they work hard, they can at least get a silver reward (Euclid Maths Competition has ten questions with ten points each. 70 points is silver level. 90 is gold levevl). When I did my Euclid Maths Competition, I just finished the first nine questions but that was OK. From my perspective, I recommend people to attend Euclid Maths Competition because it does not need so much preparation and it is a good way to improve Maths thinking.</p>
<p>Last, I will make a conclusion about these three competitions. In terms of degree of difficulty, AMC&gt; Euclid Maths Competition&gt;UKMT. In terms of time given, Euclid Maths Competition&gt;UKMT&gt;AMC. In terms of the range of knowledge tested, AMC&gt; Euclid Maths Competition=UKMT. So, we can analyze these competitions more clearly after listing their properties. As shown, UKMT is in the base. It is not difficult so it can be used to get familiar with normal Maths competitions. Euclid Maths Competition is more difficult than UKMT so people can be improved in solving Maths problems by doing it. Then, AMC is suitable for people who are willing to take challenges and want to study deeper in Maths. However, they have one thing in common, namely they can all show people’s interest in studying Maths.</p>
<p>Overall, no matter what kind of competition it is, I believe that each competition has its own </p>
