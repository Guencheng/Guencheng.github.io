        <p>​                                        The review and thoughts of my AMC contest</p>
<p>On the twentieth of February, my AMC grade was announced on the Internet. I got 78 at the end and I have to admit that I did poorly in this test. However, that is just one aspect of this test. I want to summarize the reasons for my fault and some experience I got during the time. </p>
<p>The most important point of my fault is because of my unready preparation. Since the contest was on the winter holiday and it was nearly the Spring Festival, I spent so much time on recreation that I was lax for the contest, which meant I did not do enough practice. When I realized it, it was too late. As a result, when I did my paper, I felt very nervous and perplexed. The second point I would like to mention is that I did not get the correct method to do the paper. During the contest, I just kept solving the question I met so that I forgot the time, which meant I did not have enough time to go through all questions and picked the questions that I could answer because there was only 75 minutes for this contest. Consequently, I have to remember that, when I do papers, I should do the questions that I can do first and just cross the questions that I can not solve immediately. Then, when this part is finished, I can turn over to do the questions left. In this way, I can maximize my efficiency of solving time limited papers. The last aspect I would like to say is that I have to have a relaxing mind before doing the contest. To be honest, I was very nervous at that time as I knew that I did not prepare it well. As a result, my mind was not quiet enough to do questions peacefully, which directly influenced my performance. </p>
<p>Though my preparation was not so ready, there was still something valuable I got. I had preliminarily built the ability to explain questions to foreign teachers. That was a really useful skill because, in the future, when I am abroad, I will have to explain my thoughts to my tutors and this can not be avoided so it is necessary to develop this qualification as soon as possible. In this aspect, I also want to share what I had learnt during the experience to explain questions to foreign teachers. First, when we explain a question to others, we should control the speed we speak because others may not come up with this point, we have to give them some time to think ,or nobody will know what we are saying. Also, we should describe all details because incomplete explanation is useless which means that we have to describe step by step. When we describe incompletely, some key points may be lost. As a result, it is hard for teachers to check our explanation. For example, when we explain a question to a person, first we should say why I come up with this method. Next, how to solve that. Then, show our provement. Last but not least, if we meet a question that we can not solve it, we should not give it up immediately. The first that we should do is to go through what we can do and try to make connection between them because 75% of all questions we meet are knowledge we have learnt. The reason why we can not solve it may be because we have not realized that it is the knowledge we know. Consequently, just keep our mind open and think more. In this way, even you can not solve the question to your teacher in the end, you can still show that you have clear steps on how to solve questions. Also, if you really meet an barrier, you teacher will provide you with a initial idea. Just follow and expand it.</p>
<p>Overall, the AMC contest was valuable to me and I learnt a lot from it though the result was not very pleasant. Summarize experience and try to do better next time.</p>
